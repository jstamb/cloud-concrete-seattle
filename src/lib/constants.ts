    shortDescription: "Custom-built concrete driveways designed to withstand Seattle's unique weather patterns and heavy rainfall.",
    longDescription: "A driveway is the first impression your home makes on every visitor, neighbor, and prospective buyer who pulls up to the curb. In Seattle, where first impressions are made against a backdrop of dripping firs and overcast skies, that impression needs to hold up through 37 inches of annual rainfall, unpredictable freeze-thaw cycles in January and February, and decades of daily vehicle traffic. At Cloud Concrete of Seattle, we have spent years mastering the science of high-durability residential driveways that look as good as they perform, built from the ground up to handle everything the Pacific Northwest can throw at them.\n\nEvery driveway project we take on begins well before the first truck arrives. We start with a thorough site assessment, evaluating the native soil composition beneath your property. Seattle sits on a complex mosaic of glacial till, marine clay, and fill material that behaves very differently depending on moisture content and load. In neighborhoods like Queen Anne, Magnolia, and Beacon Hill, steep grades add an additional engineering dimension that demands precise grading and drainage planning from day one. We excavate to a minimum depth of six to eight inches, removing soft or organically contaminated soil and replacing it with compacted crushed rock base that creates a stable, load-bearing platform.\n\nOnce the subgrade is prepared, we install a heavy-duty rebar grid using Grade 60 steel, typically a four-inch grid pattern for standard residential loads and a tighter configuration for driveways that will regularly support heavier vehicles like RVs or utility trucks. This steel skeleton is what prevents minor settling from becoming catastrophic cracking. We then pour a minimum 4,000 PSI concrete mix, which is specifically calibrated for the Pacific Northwest climate. This mix incorporates a low water-to-cement ratio to minimize porosity, air-entraining admixtures that create microscopic bubbles within the matrix to absorb the expansion stress of freeze-thaw cycles, and fiber reinforcement to add tensile strength throughout the slab body.\n\nDrainage is where many Seattle driveway contractors fall short, and it is where we invest the most engineering attention. A flat or improperly sloped driveway in a city that receives this much rainfall will develop standing water within seasons, and standing water accelerates every failure mode concrete has. We engineer a precise cross-slope, typically two percent, to direct runoff to the sides and into landscape swales, French drains, or city storm systems depending on the site. For particularly long driveways, we integrate channel drains or trench drains at strategic collection points to manage heavy downpour events.\n\nFinishing choices are where function meets aesthetics. Our standard broom finish provides a reliable, slip-resistant texture ideal for Seattle's wet conditions. Homeowners wanting more visual interest can pair their driveway with a brushed border and exposed aggregate center section, or go fully decorative with a stamped concrete pattern and integral color that mimics the look of cobblestone or slate. We seal every driveway we pour with a high-performance penetrating or film-forming sealant to lock out moisture from the first day of use. We also cut precisely spaced control joints that guide any natural shrinkage cracking to occur in planned, invisible lines rather than random fractures across the surface.\n\nWhen your driveway is complete, you are looking at a structure that should serve your home for 30 to 50 years with minimal maintenance. We recommend a professional re-seal every three to five years to maintain that moisture barrier and keep the surface looking fresh. If you are in Fremont, West Seattle, Wallingford, or anywhere across the greater Seattle metro area, call us at (206) 495-0997 to schedule a free on-site estimate. We will walk your property, assess the specific challenges your site presents, and give you a detailed, transparent quote that covers every phase of the project.",

    shortDescription: "Get the high-end look of stone, brick, or wood with the durability and affordability of concrete.",
    longDescription: "There is a moment, when the stamps come off a freshly poured slab and the release agent is brushed away, that never gets old. What was gray liquid an hour ago suddenly looks like hand-laid cobblestone, weathered slate, or rich chestnut hardwood. Stamped concrete delivers that transformation every single time, and it does so at a fraction of the cost of natural stone or genuine pavers, with none of the long-term maintenance headaches that come with jointed surfaces in a wet climate like Seattle's.\n\nThe Pacific Northwest is one of the most challenging environments in North America for jointed hardscaping. Natural flagstone, brick, and concrete pavers all share the same vulnerability: they have gaps. In a city that receives over 37 inches of rain annually, those gaps become channels for weed seeds, moss spores, and pooling water. Over the course of a few Seattle winters, even the most carefully installed paver patio will begin to shift, settle unevenly, and sprout invasive growth between every joint. Stamped concrete eliminates this problem entirely by creating a monolithic surface with no joints, no gaps, and no places for moss or weeds to take hold.\n\nAt Cloud Concrete of Seattle, stamped concrete is our most requested decorative service, and for good reason. We offer dozens of patterns that span the full aesthetic spectrum. Ashlar Slate is our most popular choice for covered patios and entryways, delivering a sophisticated, large-format stone appearance that pairs beautifully with the contemporary craftsman architecture common in neighborhoods like Madison Park and Laurelhurst. Roman Cobblestone is the go-to for circular driveway aprons and front walkways where old-world charm is the goal. Wood Plank stamping has surged in popularity as homeowners seek an outdoor surface that visually extends the warm interior hardwood floors common in newer Seattle construction without the obvious unsuitability of actual wood outdoors.\n\nOur color process goes far beyond surface-applied stains. We use integral color admixtures blended directly into the concrete before the pour, ensuring the hue runs throughout the full depth of the slab. If the surface ever chips or wears, the color beneath matches perfectly. We then apply an antique release agent in a contrasting secondary tone before stamping, which settles into the low points of the pattern and creates the visual depth and shadow that makes stamped concrete look genuinely three-dimensional and aged. The combination of base color and release color is what separates professional stamped work from amateur imitations.\n\nAfter the stamps are removed and the surface is detailed, we apply a high-solids acrylic sealer with UV inhibitors to lock the color in and protect the surface from Seattle's constant moisture exposure. This sealer is the critical final layer that prevents water penetration, resists tire marks on driveways, and keeps the colors vivid for years. We also add a shark-grip slip-resistant additive to every exterior stamped surface, because a beautiful patio is worthless if it becomes a skating rink every time it rains in November.\n\nStamped concrete works beautifully on patios, front walkways, pool surrounds, and driveway aprons. Many homeowners choose to combine it with standard broom-finished concrete driveways, using the stamped section as a decorative border or apron that elevates the overall aesthetic of the property without the cost of stamping an entire large surface. Contact us at (206) 495-0997 for a free design consultation, and we will bring sample boards to your property so you can see exactly how the color and pattern combinations will look in your specific outdoor environment.",

    shortDescription: "Create the ultimate outdoor living space with a custom-poured concrete patio.",
    longDescription: "Anyone who has spent a July evening in Seattle knows exactly what is at stake. The light lingers until nearly ten at night, the air smells like cedar and salt water, and the whole city migrates outdoors. A well-designed concrete patio is the anchor of that experience, the surface that transforms a sloped, muddy backyard into a genuine outdoor living room. At Cloud Concrete of Seattle, we design and pour patios that are engineered for year-round Pacific Northwest conditions, not just the glorious three months of summer when everything is easy.\n\nThe challenge with Seattle patios is that the other nine months of the year are working against you. From October through June, the region receives the bulk of its 37-plus inches of annual rainfall, and a patio that was not specifically designed for drainage will pool, stain, and deteriorate far ahead of its expected lifespan. Before we ever touch a form board or order a yard of concrete, we study how water currently moves across your property. We look at the grade relative to your house foundation, the location of downspouts, and the soil conditions that determine how quickly water will drain away from the slab. Many Seattle backyards, particularly in neighborhoods like Greenwood, Ravenna, and Columbia City, sit on heavy glacial clay that drains very slowly, requiring us to integrate perimeter French drains or surface channel drains into the patio design.\n\nOnce drainage is solved, the structural build begins. We excavate to remove the native soil, install a compacted gravel base of four to six inches to provide both stability and drainage capacity beneath the slab, and then set our forms with precision laser levels to ensure an absolute minimum two-percent slope away from the house. The concrete mix we specify for residential patios is a minimum 3,500 PSI standard mix, upgraded to 4,000 PSI or higher for larger slabs or sites with challenging soil conditions. We reinforce every slab with a welded wire mesh or rebar grid depending on the size and load requirements, and we cut control joints at regular intervals to manage the natural shrinkage cracking that occurs as concrete cures.\n\nFinishing is where the patio takes on its personality. The most practical and cost-effective choice for a Seattle outdoor slab is the broom finish, which creates a fine directional texture that sheds water and provides reliable traction even when wet. For homeowners who want something more distinctive, we offer a full suite of decorative options. Exposed aggregate finishes are extremely popular for their natural appearance and outstanding slip resistance, particularly around hot tubs and outdoor kitchens. Stamped concrete patterns in stone or tile configurations can elevate a standard backyard into something that feels intentionally designed. Integral color or acid staining adds depth and warmth that plain gray simply cannot match.\n\nMany of our clients pair their new patio with complementary concrete features. A set of concrete steps connecting the patio to the back door eliminates the trip hazard of mismatched grade changes. A concrete retaining wall along the back or side edge of the patio creates a level usable surface on what was previously a sloped and unusable yard. Concrete curbing around adjacent garden beds defines the space and prevents landscape material from washing onto the patio surface during heavy rain events.\n\nWe handle every aspect of the project from initial design consultation through final sealing, including any permit requirements for your specific neighborhood and lot. Call us at (206) 495-0997 for a free on-site estimate, and let us help you design the patio that will make those long Seattle summer evenings something your family looks forward to for decades.",

    shortDescription: "Structural integrity starts from the ground up. Professional foundation services for homes and additions.",
    longDescription: "A foundation is not a commodity. It is the single most consequential structural decision made in the life of any building, and in Seattle, the geological and environmental variables that govern a foundation's long-term performance are more complex than in almost any other major American city. At Cloud Concrete of Seattle, our structural team approaches every foundation project with the rigor and precision the work demands, because we understand that everything built above grade is only as reliable as the concrete we pour below it.\n\nSeattle's subsurface geology is the first challenge every foundation contractor in this city must confront honestly. The region sits on a layered combination of glacial till, marine clay, loose sand, and in some low-lying areas near the waterfront and South Lake Union, historic fill material that can be highly unpredictable under load. Glacial till, the dense, compacted material left behind by the retreating Vashon glacier, is an excellent bearing surface when you can reach it. The problem is that it is often overlain by expansive clay layers that swell significantly when saturated and contract when dry, creating the cyclical heave-and-settle movement that damages foundations over decades. Our process always begins with a review of available geotechnical data for the site and, when warranted, we recommend a formal soil report before committing to a foundation design.\n\nSeattle's seismic environment adds another layer of engineering complexity. The Pacific Northwest sits atop the Cascadia Subduction Zone, one of the most significant seismic hazards in North America. The City of Seattle's building codes reflect this reality, requiring specific reinforcement standards for all new foundations and structural slabs. Our team designs and pours foundations in full compliance with the current Seattle Building Code and the International Building Code, incorporating the required rebar schedules, anchor bolt specifications, and connection hardware that ensure the structure above can move with seismic forces rather than fracturing at the base.\n\nFor residential projects, we handle the full range of foundation types that Seattle's varied housing stock requires. Continuous perimeter stem walls are the standard for new wood-frame construction, poured to a depth below the frost line with a level top plate for framing attachment. Monolithic slabs, where the thickened edge and interior slab are poured as a single unit, are used for ADUs, garage additions, and additions where the site conditions support it. Crawl space foundations require careful attention to vapor barriers and foundation vents to manage the chronic moisture issue that plagues countless older Seattle homes, where inadequate original moisture management has led to wood rot and mold in the structural framing above.\n\nEvery foundation we pour receives a minimum 4,000 PSI concrete mix with the appropriate admixtures for the pour conditions, whether that means accelerators for cold weather pours in winter or retarders for large continuous pours in summer to prevent premature set. We install a minimum 6-mil vapor barrier beneath all ground-contact slabs and integrate drainage mat systems against basement walls where hydrostatic pressure is a concern. Form work is checked for level and plumb before every pour, because a foundation that comes out of the ground a quarter-inch out of level creates cascading problems for every trade that follows.\n\nIf you are planning a home addition, building a new ADU in your backyard, or need to address an existing foundation issue, call Cloud Concrete of Seattle at (206) 495-0997 for a consultation. We will assess your site, review any available soil data, and provide a foundation design recommendation that meets code, suits your soil, and gives the structure above it the stable, durable base it deserves.",

    shortDescription: "Tame Seattle's hilly terrain with engineered concrete retaining walls that add value and safety.",
    longDescription: "Seattle is not a flat city. Anyone who has driven through Queen Anne, Phinney Ridge, West Seattle, or Capitol Hill understands that the topography here is dramatic, and that drama creates both the challenge and the opportunity that retaining walls exist to address. A properly engineered concrete retaining wall does not just hold back soil. It transforms an unusable sloped yard into a series of level terraces, eliminates the ongoing erosion that slowly steals topsoil and undermines adjacent structures, and when designed thoughtfully, adds a defining architectural element to the property that improves curb appeal and market value simultaneously.\n\nThe forces acting against a retaining wall are significant and often underestimated by property owners who attempt to manage slope issues with timber, modular block, or improperly designed systems. In Seattle's climate, soil behind a retaining wall becomes saturated during the long rainy season, adding substantial hydrostatic pressure to the already considerable lateral earth pressure the wall must resist. When that saturated soil freezes during one of our occasional cold snaps in January or February, the expansion adds another surge of force against the wall face. A wall that was not engineered to handle these combined loads will fail, sometimes gradually through visible leaning and cracking, and sometimes suddenly and catastrophically.\n\nAt Cloud Concrete of Seattle, every retaining wall project begins with an engineering analysis of the site. We assess the height of the proposed wall, the soil type and condition behind it, the surcharge load from any structures, driveways, or heavy plantings above the wall line, and the drainage situation that must be managed. For walls under four feet in retained height, a well-designed gravity wall relying on its own mass for stability is often the most cost-effective solution. These are typically poured-in-place concrete or high-density segmental block systems. For walls retaining more than four feet of soil, which is extremely common on Seattle's steep residential lots, cantilevered designs with a concrete footing that extends back under the retained soil provide the structural capacity that gravity walls cannot.\n\nDrainage is perhaps the single most important detail in retaining wall construction, yet it is the detail most often skipped by less experienced contractors. We install a continuous layer of drainage rock directly behind every wall face, typically extending from the footing to within a foot of the top of the wall, and we install perforated drain pipe at the base of that drainage aggregate that carries accumulated water to daylight or to a storm system. Without this drainage layer, hydrostatic pressure builds behind the wall during every rain event, and it is only a matter of time before that pressure overcomes the structural capacity of the wall.\n\nBeyond pure function, retaining walls are an opportunity to add genuine design value to a property. Poured-in-place concrete walls can be given textured form liner finishes that mimic stone or wood grain. Architectural block systems come in a wide range of colors and profiles that complement the naturalistic Pacific Northwest landscape. Many of our clients in Madrona, Leschi, and Seward Park have transformed steep, unusable backyards into beautiful terraced outdoor spaces with poured walls forming the structure and stamped concrete patios filling the level terraces between them.\n\nIf your property is losing ground to erosion, if you have a slope that limits what you can do with your yard, or if you need to create a level pad for a new structure or addition, call Cloud Concrete of Seattle at (206) 495-0997 for a free on-site evaluation and estimate.",

    shortDescription: "Heavy-duty concrete garage floors designed to withstand vehicle weight and chemicals.",
    longDescription: "The garage floor is one of the most overlooked and most abused concrete surfaces on any residential property. It bears the weight of thousands of pounds of vehicle, absorbs oil drips, brake fluid, and road salt tracked in on tires, endures the thermal shock of cold rain-soaked cars on a temperature-changed slab, and in Seattle's climate, it does all of this while managing moisture that tries to migrate up through the slab from the saturated soil beneath. A garage floor that was not poured correctly from the start will crack, spall, and deteriorate in ways that are expensive to remediate and impossible to fully reverse.\n\nAt Cloud Concrete of Seattle, our garage floor work begins with the same meticulous subgrade preparation we bring to any structural slab. We remove the existing material if we are replacing an old floor, compact the native soil, and install a minimum four-inch crushed gravel base that provides both load distribution and drainage capacity beneath the slab. This gravel base is critical in Seattle's wet climate because it creates a capillary break that prevents ground moisture from wicking upward through the concrete, which is the primary cause of the white efflorescence staining and surface spalling that plagues poorly built garage floors across the city.\n\nOver the gravel base, we install a 6-mil polyethylene vapor barrier with all seams overlapped and taped, creating a continuous moisture membrane beneath the slab. This is a step that many budget concrete contractors skip to save thirty minutes of labor, and it is the step that makes the difference between a garage floor that stays dry and one that always feels damp, grows mold around the perimeter, and causes stored items to rust or degrade. We then place rebar or a minimum six-by-six welded wire mesh reinforcement over the vapor barrier before pouring a 4,000 PSI concrete mix to a standard four-inch thickness, upgraded to five or six inches in sections that will regularly support a loaded trailer, recreational vehicle, or heavy shop equipment.\n\nFinishing determines both the aesthetics and the functionality of the completed floor. Our standard garage finish is a medium broom texture that provides traction, conceals minor imperfections, and accepts coatings well if the homeowner chooses to add a protective layer down the road. We also offer a smoother steel-trowel finish for clients who plan to apply an epoxy coating immediately, as this surface provides the best mechanical bond for coating adhesion. We cut control joints in a grid pattern to manage shrinkage cracking, directing any natural movement to the joints rather than random fractures across the field of the slab.\n\nFor clients who want to take their garage floor to the next level, we offer professional-grade polyaspartic and epoxy coating systems that are dramatically more durable than the DIY box-store kits that fail within a season or two. These commercial-grade coatings create an impermeable surface that repels oil, transmission fluid, and road chemicals, cleans with a mop rather than requiring scrubbing, and completely transforms the look of the space from utilitarian to showroom-quality. The process requires proper surface preparation including diamond grinding to open the concrete profile, and we handle the full scope from prep through topcoat.\n\nWhether you are pouring a floor for a new garage addition, replacing a deteriorated slab in an existing attached garage, or finishing a detached workshop space in Ballard, Wallingford, or anywhere across the Seattle metro area, call us at (206) 495-0997 for a free estimate.

    shortDescription: "Safe, durable, and attractive walkways and sidewalks for residential and commercial properties.",
    longDescription: "Concrete sidewalks in Seattle occupy a unique intersection of private property responsibility and public safety obligation. The City of Seattle holds property owners responsible for maintaining the sidewalk along their frontage, meaning that a cracked, heaved, or deteriorated sidewalk panel in front of your home is not just an eyesore — it is a liability and a potential violation notice waiting to happen. At Cloud Concrete of Seattle, we specialize in both new sidewalk installation and the repair and replacement of damaged panels, and we navigate the City of Seattle's permitting and inspection process on your behalf so the project is handled correctly from start to finish.\n\nSeattle's sidewalk environment is genuinely demanding. The combination of constant moisture, the freeze-thaw cycles that occasionally hit during January and February cold snaps, and the relentless pressure of tree roots from the large-caliper street trees planted throughout neighborhoods like Ballard, Capitol Hill, and the University District creates a perpetual cycle of sidewalk damage across the city. Established street trees like London planes, maples, and Japanese zelkovas are beloved features of Seattle's residential character, but their root systems will eventually find and exploit any weakness in adjacent concrete. We work with arborists and city arborist guidelines to navigate tree-root conflicts, sometimes installing root barriers during our reconstruction work to protect the new slab from accelerated future damage.\n\nThe technical requirements for a City of Seattle public sidewalk are more specific than a typical residential flatwork pour. Sidewalks in the public right-of-way must meet SDOT Street Use permit standards, which specify minimum thickness of four inches on a compacted base, cross-slopes not to exceed two percent for ADA compliance, and transitions that accommodate wheelchair access at curb ramps and driveway approaches. ADA compliance is not optional. Sidewalks that are inaccessible to people using mobility aids create liability for the city and the adjacent property owner, and SDOT enforcement has become increasingly active in flagging non-compliant conditions during street improvement projects across Seattle neighborhoods.\n\nOur process begins with pulling the required SDOT Street Use permit, which governs any work within the public right-of-way. This permit involves a site plan review and typically requires a pre-inspection meeting with SDOT before work begins and a final inspection after completion. We handle the full permit application and all communication with SDOT inspectors, saving homeowners the hours of navigation that the city's permitting process can require. For purely private walkways from the public sidewalk to your front door, city permits are not required, but our construction standards remain the same: compacted base, properly reinforced slab, controlled joints, and a durable broom finish that provides safe footing through Seattle's wet season.\n\nFor existing sidewalks with isolated damaged panels, full replacement is often not necessary. We can remove and replace individual panels that have heaved, cracked, or spalled while matching the color and texture of adjacent sections as closely as possible. For widespread cracking that has not yet resulted in vertical displacement, concrete grinding can remove trip hazards and extend the serviceable life of the existing slab. We assess each situation individually and recommend the most cost-effective approach that genuinely solves the underlying problem rather than just patching the symptoms.\n\nPrivate front walkways are an opportunity to elevate curb appeal significantly. While the standard broom finish is always appropriate, homeowners choosing to pair their sidewalk project with decorative concrete or exposed aggregate can create an entry sequence that genuinely distinguishes their home on the block.

    shortDescription: "A rugged, non-slip decorative finish that showcases the natural beauty of stone.",
    longDescription: "There is a reason exposed aggregate concrete has been the finish of choice for Pacific Northwest driveways, patios, and walkways for generations. It is not nostalgia. It is physics. By washing away the cement paste from the surface of freshly poured concrete and revealing the decorative stone embedded within the mix, you create a surface with a naturally irregular, multi-point texture that provides outstanding traction in wet conditions. In a city that receives over 37 inches of annual rainfall and whose residents are walking, running, and driving on wet surfaces for nine months of the year, that traction advantage is not a minor benefit. It is a primary design consideration.\n\nThe exposed aggregate process looks deceptively simple from the outside, but timing is everything. After the concrete is placed and screeded, a surface retarder is applied to the top of the slab to slow the set of the surface paste while the concrete beneath continues to harden normally. At the precise moment when the base concrete has reached the right strength — typically several hours after the pour, depending on temperature and humidity — we pressure wash the surface to remove the retarded paste and expose the top layer of aggregate. If we act too early, the stones pull out and the surface is ruined. If we wait too long, the paste has hardened and cannot be removed without damaging the stones. This is craft work, and our experienced crews have the eye and the timing to execute it correctly every time.\n\nThe aggregate itself is where the design decisions become interesting. Standard ready-mix concrete contains whatever local aggregate the batch plant uses, typically a combination of rounded river rock and crushed stone in a neutral gray-tan palette. For clients who want more visual impact, we work with specialty aggregate mixes that incorporate river pea gravel in warm brown and rust tones, black basalt for a dramatic dark contrast, or quartz and granite chips that catch the light with a subtle sparkle. The aggregate color and size are selected to complement the specific architecture and landscape of the property, and we always provide samples before committing to a mix design.\n\nExposed aggregate is particularly well-suited to Seattle's specific surface applications. On driveways, the texture handles tire wear and the visual demands of street-facing prominence equally well, and the natural variation in aggregate color conceals the inevitable tire marks and surface staining that accumulate over time on any driveway surface. On patios, the surface feels comfortable underfoot, does not retain heat the way dark-colored smooth concrete does, and provides the grip needed around outdoor kitchens and bar areas where spills are inevitable. For pool decks, exposed aggregate is often the recommended finish because of the maximum wet traction it provides around water, and the ability to select light-colored aggregate that reflects heat and remains comfortable to walk on barefoot.\n\nBecause exposed aggregate surfaces have a slightly more porous character than troweled or broom-finished concrete, proper sealing is particularly important. We seal every exposed aggregate surface we install with a high-quality penetrating silane-siloxane sealer that locks out moisture and prevents the oil and chemical staining that can discolor the aggregate over time. This sealer also makes maintenance dramatically easier, as dirt and debris wash off the textured surface cleanly without accumulating in the aggregate voids.\n\nExposed aggregate pairs beautifully with smooth concrete borders and stamped concrete accent panels. Many clients choose a decorative banding of stamped or stained concrete around the perimeter of an exposed aggregate driveway or patio, creating a finished, intentional appearance that elevates the overall design.

    longDescription: "Commercial concrete is a different discipline from residential work, and it demands a different level of operational capability, engineering rigor, and project management sophistication. When a Seattle business owner hires a concrete contractor, the stakes are higher than a backyard patio. A failed warehouse floor costs money in downtime, equipment damage, and remediation. A loading dock built to the wrong grade creates safety hazards and operational inefficiencies that compound every day. A parking lot that cracks and deteriorates within a few years damages the company's image and generates a replacement cost that a properly engineered original installation would have deferred by decades. At Cloud Concrete of Seattle, we bring the engineering depth and crew capacity that commercial clients require.\n\nOur commercial flatwork portfolio spans the full range of industrial and business applications in the greater Seattle metro area. We pour warehouse and distribution center floors for the logistics, manufacturing, and technology sectors that have driven significant industrial construction across Georgetown, SoDo, Tukwila, and the broader Kent Valley corridor over the past decade. These floors are engineered from the slab design down, specifying concrete mix designs, thickness, joint spacing, and surface flatness tolerances based on the specific use requirements of the facility. A floor that will carry forklifts requires a different specification than one that will primarily support foot traffic and light carts. We work from structural engineer drawings when provided and can connect clients with trusted commercial structural engineers when a formal design is needed.\n\nLoading docks are one of our most technically demanding commercial applications. The geometry must accommodate the precise height requirements of the delivery vehicles that will use the dock, the dock levelers and seals that bridge the gap between truck bed and dock floor, and the turning radius and approach grade constraints of the site. Getting any of these dimensions wrong creates operational problems that cannot be corrected without demolition and repour. Our project managers review dock requirements in detail with the client before any formwork is set, confirming vehicle types, leveler specifications, and operational workflow to ensure the finished structure functions exactly as intended.\n\nCommercial parking lots represent another major segment of our work. Seattle's climate is uniquely challenging for asphalt, which softens in summer heat and becomes brittle in cold, but concrete parking lots in this climate perform exceptionally well across all seasons and require dramatically less maintenance over a 30-to-40-year service life. We design commercial parking lots with the appropriate subbase depth for the expected traffic loading, integrate storm drainage into the pavement design to comply with Seattle and King County stormwater management requirements, and specify joint patterns that accommodate the thermal expansion and contraction cycles of large concrete panels.\n\nSchedule management is a commercial differentiator that residential concrete work does not require in the same way. A business cannot simply close its parking lot or warehouse floor for two weeks while a concrete contractor works at a comfortable pace. We develop detailed phasing plans for projects where portions of the facility must remain operational throughout construction, coordinate pours around the client's business schedule, and deploy the crew size and equipment capacity needed to meet deadlines without compromising quality. Our project managers maintain active communication with business owners and general contractors throughout the project so there are no surprises.\n\nFor commercial concrete inquiries in Seattle, Bellevue, Renton, Tukwila, and throughout the Puget Sound region, contact Cloud Concrete of Seattle at (206) 495-0997.

At Cloud Concrete of Seattle, we approach concrete repair diagnostically rather than cosmetically, because a repair that only addresses the surface symptom without correcting the underlying cause is money wasted.\n\nThe most common repair call we receive is for cracked concrete. Not all cracks are equal. Hairline cracks, typically less than one-sixteenth of an inch wide, are usually the result of normal concrete shrinkage during curing and present no structural concern. They do, however, provide an entry point for water, and in Seattle's perpetually wet climate, water in a crack is a problem that grows with each freeze-thaw cycle. When water enters a crack and freezes, it expands with significant force, widening the crack, allowing more water entry, and beginning a progressive deterioration cycle that ultimately leads to spalling and structural failure. We seal hairline cracks with polyurethane or epoxy injection systems that penetrate the full depth of the crack and create a flexible, waterproof bond that moves with the concrete rather than cracking again.\n\nWider structural cracks, particularly those that show vertical displacement between the two sides of the crack, indicate that the concrete panels have moved independently of each other due to subgrade settlement or erosion beneath the slab. These repairs require more than crack filling. We diagnose the cause of the movement, address any drainage or subgrade issues contributing to ongoing settlement, and then repair the crack with structural epoxy or polymer-modified mortar systems designed to restore load transfer across the joint. In some cases where the subgrade has washed out beneath the slab, we recommend complementary slab lifting as part of the repair scope to bring the settled panel back to grade before sealing.\n\nSpalling, the flaking and pitting of the concrete surface that is extremely common on Seattle driveways and patios poured more than fifteen years ago, is typically caused by one of two sources. In older slabs, it is often the result of freeze-thaw damage in concrete that was not air-entrained, meaning the mix lacked the microscopic air voids that allow the paste to absorb ice expansion stress. In newer slabs, spalling is frequently caused by deicing chemicals applied during the rare Seattle snowstorms, which chemically attack the surface paste. We repair spalling with polymer-modified concrete overlay systems that bond at the molecular level to the existing concrete surface, creating a new wear surface that is properly air-entrained and moisture-resistant. These overlays can be applied as thin as one-quarter inch and can be colored or textured to match the surrounding concrete.\n\nUneven concrete panels that create trip hazards are both a liability and a nuisance. Before recommending replacement, we evaluate whether concrete grinding can safely reduce the vertical lip to an acceptable level, or whether slab lifting can restore the settled panel to its original grade without any demolition. Grinding is fast, clean, and costs a fraction of replacement. Slab lifting using polyurethane foam injection can lift a settled driveway panel or patio section in under an hour with no curing time and no disruption to adjacent landscaping.\n\nProper concrete repair begins with an accurate diagnosis. If your driveway, patio, sidewalk, or garage floor is showing any of these symptoms, call Cloud Concrete of Seattle at (206) 495-0997 for a free assessment. We will give you an honest evaluation of the repair options, the expected service life extension each option provides, and a transparent comparison of repair versus replacement costs so you can make the best decision for your property.",

    shortDescription: "Fix sunken slabs and trip hazards with precise concrete leveling and lifting.",
    longDescription: "Sunken concrete is one of the most common problems facing Seattle homeowners, and it is almost never caused by poor concrete work. The real culprit is the ground beneath it. Seattle sits on a complex patchwork of glacial till, marine clay, and organic fill — soils that shift, compress, and wash away with every passing rainy season. When the subsoil erodes or compresses unevenly, the concrete above loses its support and begins to sink, crack, and tilt. The result is a trip hazard on your front walk, a low spot on your driveway that pools standing water, or a garage floor that no longer lines up with the overhead door threshold. These are not cosmetic nuisances — they are safety liabilities and early warning signs of accelerating structural failure.\n\nAt Cloud Concrete of Seattle, we approach concrete leveling with two proven methodologies, and we select the right one based on a thorough site assessment. Polyurethane foam injection — sometimes called polyjacking or foam lifting — involves drilling a series of small, penny-sized holes through the sunken slab, then injecting a high-density, two-part expanding foam into the void beneath. Within seconds, the foam expands to fill the cavity, compresses the underlying soil, and lifts the concrete back to its original elevation with millimeter-level precision. The foam cures to a hard, water-resistant, permanent solid within 15 minutes, meaning you can walk on the surface the same day and drive on it within hours. This technique is ideal for walkways, pool decks, driveway panels, and interior slabs where minimizing downtime is critical.\n\nFor situations where larger voids exist or soil conditions require bulk material, we also employ traditional mudjacking — a technique that pumps a pressurized slurry of Portland cement, water, and soil through larger-diameter holes to fill cavities and hydraulically lift the slab. Mudjacking has a longer track record on the market and remains an excellent, cost-effective solution for garage floors and larger flatwork areas where the primary goal is stability and structural support rather than cosmetic perfection.\n\nBoth methods cost a fraction of full slab demolition and replacement. When you factor in the cost of breaking out old concrete, hauling away debris, re-grading the subbase, and pouring a new slab, leveling consistently delivers savings of 50 to 75 percent. Just as importantly, it eliminates the significant embodied-carbon footprint of new concrete production — a meaningful consideration for environmentally conscious homeowners in the Emerald City.\n\nWe serve neighborhoods across Seattle where settling slabs are especially prevalent, including Beacon Hill, West Seattle, and the Rainier Valley, where hillside lots, clay-heavy soils, and older infrastructure create prime conditions for void development beneath slabs. After any leveling job, we strongly recommend pairing the repair with professional concrete sealing to prevent future water infiltration that accelerates the same soil erosion cycle all over again. We also inspect adjacent slabs and expansion joints as part of every evaluation, because a sunken panel rarely sinks in isolation — where one void exists, others are often forming nearby.\n\nIf you have noticed an uneven surface on your property, do not wait until someone trips or until the gap grows large enough to require full replacement. Reach out to us at (206) 495-0997 or visit our contact page to schedule a free, no-obligation assessment. We will measure the differential, probe the void, and give you a straight answer about whether leveling is the right solution or whether replacement is genuinely warranted — with no pressure either way.",

    shortDescription: "Slip-resistant and beautiful concrete pool decks for Seattle backyards.",
    longDescription: "A pool deck is the most demanding concrete surface a residential property can have. It is wet constantly, subject to heavy foot traffic from wet bare feet, exposed to pool chemicals that can degrade inferior materials, and in Seattle's climate it also has to contend with the freeze-thaw cycles that affect every outdoor concrete surface in the Pacific Northwest. Getting the surface specification wrong means a deck that is slippery the moment anyone steps out of the water, one that spalls within a few winters, or one that becomes uncomfortably hot on the rare Seattle days when the sun actually shines. Cloud Concrete of Seattle has the experience and the product knowledge to design pool deck systems that perform across every one of those variables simultaneously.\n\nThe foundation of every pool deck we build is the concrete itself. We specify a 4,000 PSI air-entrained mix for all pool deck pours, with the air-entrainment component being particularly critical in Seattle's climate. Air-entrained concrete contains billions of tiny air bubbles distributed uniformly throughout the mix, which compress and expand as freeze-thaw cycles occur rather than allowing water to fracture the matrix from within. Without this, even a beautifully finished pool deck will begin to spall and delaminate within a handful of winters in a city that sees temperatures dip below freezing multiple times per year.\n\nSlip resistance is the non-negotiable design priority for any pool surround. We achieve this through several overlapping approaches. A light broom finish on the base concrete creates an inherent surface texture. For decorative applications, we specify stamped patterns with deliberate texture depth that maintains grip even when soaking wet. Our cool-deck coating system — a spray-applied acrylic finish that is textured and highly slip-resistant — is particularly popular because it also reflects heat rather than absorbing it, meaning the surface stays comfortable under bare feet even on those warm July afternoons when the sun breaks through the clouds over Lake Washington. For homeowners who want the most natural-looking finish, exposed aggregate is an outstanding pool deck option, providing exceptional grip through its stone texture while complementing the lush Pacific Northwest landscaping that surrounds most Seattle backyard pools.\n\nDrainage is engineered into every pool deck design from day one. The deck slopes away from the pool edge at a two-percent grade minimum, directing splash-out and rain away from the pool and toward landscape drainage or a perimeter drain system. This prevents the standing water that would otherwise accelerate surface degradation and create the slipping hazard that makes pool decks dangerous. We also address the pool-to-deck joint carefully, installing a flexible bond-breaker joint compound that accommodates the differential movement between the pool shell and the surrounding slab without cracking.\n\nBeyond the structural and safety specifications, pool decks are outdoor showpieces. Many of our Laurelhurst, Windermere, and Mercer Island clients use their pool deck as the centerpiece of a comprehensive outdoor living space, incorporating stamped concrete borders, colored concrete fields, and complementary concrete patio areas that flow seamlessly from the pool surround into the broader backyard design. We coordinate with landscape architects and pool contractors throughout the build to ensure every surface, grade, and drainage component works together as a unified system.\n\nIf you are building a new pool or replacing a deteriorated deck around an existing one, call us at (206) 495-0997 for a free site consultation. We will evaluate your drainage conditions, discuss your finish preferences, and put together a pool deck design that will serve your family safely and beautifully for decades.",

    shortDescription: "Precision-poured concrete slabs for sheds, garages, and secondary structures.",
    longDescription: "Every structure begins as an idea, and every idea that is built above the ground in Seattle must start with a concrete slab that can hold it there reliably through decades of wet winters, clay-soil movement, and the cyclical moisture loading that is simply the reality of building in the Pacific Northwest. At Cloud Concrete of Seattle, concrete slab work is the core of our craft — the discipline we have refined through hundreds of pours across every neighborhood in the city, from small backyard shed pads in Wallingford to large detached garage slabs in Laurelhurst to commercial warehouse floors in Georgetown and SoDo.\n\nThe first question we answer on every slab project is what is below grade. Seattle's subsurface is genuinely variable, and a slab poured over soft fill or expansive clay without proper base preparation will settle, crack, and heave regardless of how good the concrete above it is. Our standard process begins with excavation to remove the existing native soil to a depth determined by the slab thickness and base requirements — typically six to eight inches below finished grade for a residential slab. We then compact a base of three-quarter-inch crushed rock to a minimum four-inch depth, a critical step that provides both a stable bearing surface and a drainage layer that allows water to move away from the underside of the slab rather than becoming trapped and creating hydrostatic pressure.\n\nFor any slab that will serve as a structural floor — a garage, workshop, or secondary living space — we install a full 6-mil polyethylene vapor barrier over the compacted base before placing any concrete. Seattle's persistent moisture means that ground vapor migration through an unsealed slab is a genuine concern, and a vapor barrier is the difference between a dry floor and one that wicks moisture and eventually supports mold or wood rot in any framing placed above it. For slabs adjacent to exterior footings, we integrate the vapor barrier with the waterproofing detail at the footing edge to create a continuous moisture management system.\n\nReinforcement is specified based on the intended use and the span of the slab. A backyard shed pad on stable, well-compacted soil may call for welded wire mesh at mid-depth, while a detached garage floor that will see vehicle loads and potentially support heavy shelving units receives a full rebar grid on chairs at the appropriate depth from the bottom of the slab. We use 3,500 to 4,000 PSI concrete for all residential slabs, with a low water-to-cement ratio that minimizes porosity and maximizes long-term durability. Fiber reinforcement additives are included in our standard mix to provide tensile strength distribution throughout the slab body that reduces surface cracking.\n\nLaser leveling is the finishing discipline that separates a professional slab from an amateur one. Using a rotating laser level, we establish absolute grade references across the entire slab form before the pour begins, and our finishers work from these references as they screed, float, and trowel the surface. For slabs that will receive tile, flooring, or any finish material sensitive to variation, we hold tolerances of one-eighth inch over ten feet. Control joints are cut into every slab at intervals no greater than 2.5 times the slab thickness in feet, directing the natural shrinkage cracking that occurs as concrete cures into planned, straight lines rather than random surface fractures.\n\nAfter curing, we recommend sealing your slab to lock out moisture, oil, and surface staining.

    longDescription: "The word concrete carries a lot of baggage. Gray. Industrial. Cold. For most of the twentieth century, those associations were largely accurate — concrete was a structural material, a utilitarian necessity that was hidden beneath tile, carpet, or hardwood the moment a building was enclosed. That relationship has changed fundamentally over the past two decades, and today's decorative concrete techniques produce surfaces of such sophistication and beauty that even professional interior designers regularly specify them for high-end residential projects. At Cloud Concrete of Seattle, our decorative work spans the full spectrum from subtle acid-stained floors that look like aged Italian marble to heavily textured outdoor surfaces that evoke the rugged volcanic stone of the Pacific Northwest landscape.\n\nAcid staining is one of the most distinctive and irreplaceable decorative techniques available for existing concrete floors. When a reactive acid solution is applied to a cured concrete surface, it chemically bonds with the calcium compounds in the cement paste to produce deep, variegated color patterns that are genuinely unique to each slab. No two acid-stained floors look alike, because the reaction depends on the specific mineral content and hydration history of each unique concrete pour. The result is a floor with the kind of organic color depth and variation that no tile or painted surface can replicate. Earth tones — terracotta, coffee, sage, and slate — are the most popular choices in Seattle, where they harmonize with the natural materials and muted palette typical of Pacific Northwest interior design.\n\nFor newer concrete or for projects where a more uniform color is desired, water-based concrete stains and dyes offer a wider palette and more predictable results. These penetrating colorants soak into the concrete pores rather than reacting chemically with the surface, producing vivid, consistent hues that can range from subtle warm grays to bold charcoals and deep blues. They are particularly popular for polished concrete floors in modern Seattle lofts and open-plan homes in South Lake Union and Capitol Hill, where a clean industrial aesthetic is the design intention.\n\nScoring and engraving transform a plain concrete surface into a geometric or organic design by cutting patterns directly into the hardened slab. Custom tile-grid patterns, compass rose medallions, and flowing curves are all achievable through controlled scoring, and the grooves can be left natural or filled with contrasting color to emphasize the design. This technique is especially effective in entryways, covered patios, and indoor great rooms where a bespoke floor design becomes the defining visual feature of the space.\n\nOverlays and microtoppings represent another dimension of decorative concrete work, allowing us to apply thin, polymer-modified concrete coatings over existing surfaces to completely transform their appearance. A concrete overlay can turn a stained, cracked, or dated garage floor into a smooth, seamlessly colored interior-grade surface without the cost and disruption of full demolition. Microtoppings — ultra-thin applications of one to two millimeters — are used for interior floors and countertops where the goal is a minimalist, seamless stone-like appearance.\n\nAll of our decorative surfaces are finished with a high-performance sealer appropriate to the application, from penetrating silane-siloxane sealers for exterior surfaces that need moisture protection without changing the surface appearance, to high-gloss polyurethane topcoats for interior floors that need durable, easy-clean protection with a distinctive sheen.

    shortDescription: "Permanent, attractive landscape borders and garden edging.",
    longDescription: "There is a detail in landscaping that separates a yard that looks maintained from one that looks merely mowed, and that detail is the edge. A crisp, permanent border between a garden bed and a lawn, between a mulched planting area and a driveway, between a concrete walkway and the surrounding grade — that line is what gives a property its sense of intentionality, its signal that someone cared enough to get the details right. Plastic edging goes wobbly within a season. Steel edging rusts and migrates. Wood edging rots in Seattle's perpetual moisture. Concrete curbing is the only edging solution that installs once and holds its line for the life of the property.\n\nAt Cloud Concrete of Seattle, we install extruded concrete curbing using a continuous pour process that produces a seamless, monolithic border with no seams, no joints, and no weak points where water can infiltrate and cause damage. Our curbing machine extrudes the concrete through a shaped die directly onto the prepared surface, forming a precisely profiled border in a single continuous pass. This process is dramatically faster than hand-forming and produces a more consistent, professional result — a clean, smooth arc on curves, and a perfectly straight line on straight runs, with no evidence of the human hand in the finished product.\n\nThe most popular curbing profile we install is the mower-friendly rounded top, which features a gentle curve that a lawn mower wheel can ride up and over without catching, eliminating the hand-trimming that traditional flat-topped edging requires. This profile is also inherently structurally superior, as the rounded section distributes stress more effectively than a sharp-edged design. For more formal or architectural applications, we also install a straight-top curbing with defined, angular edges that complement the clean lines of contemporary Seattle residential landscapes.\n\nColor and texture options make concrete curbing a genuine design element rather than just a functional separator. We offer a full range of integral color admixtures that match or complement your home's exterior palette — warm tans and browns for craftsman homes, cool grays and charcoals for modern architecture, terracotta tones for Mediterranean-inspired landscapes. Stamped texture options including cobblestone, brick, and slate patterns can also be applied to the exposed face of the curbing, adding decorative detail that ties the edging to other concrete elements on the property such as a stamped concrete patio or driveway apron.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, concrete curbing acts as an effective root barrier that keeps aggressive ornamental grasses, ground covers, and perennial spreaders from migrating into adjacent lawn areas or pathway surfaces. In Seattle, where moist conditions encourage particularly vigorous plant growth, this containment function is genuinely valuable and reduces the ongoing maintenance burden on the homeowner. The curbing also prevents mulch and bark from migrating out of planting beds during Seattle's heavy rain events, a persistent nuisance with any edging system that does not create a continuous vertical barrier.\n\nInstallation is typically completed in a single day for most residential properties. The material cures within 24 hours and achieves full strength within a week.

    shortDescription: "The classic, durable, and slip-resistant standard for Seattle walkways.",
    longDescription: "There is a reason the broom finish has been the standard finish for exterior concrete in the Pacific Northwest for generations. It works. In a region where rain falls on more than 150 days per year and where morning dew keeps surfaces wet for hours after any precipitation stops, a surface that provides reliable traction underfoot is not a nicety — it is a safety requirement. The broom finish achieves this requirement through a simple, elegant mechanism: by dragging a specialized concrete broom across the surface of freshly floated concrete, a contractor creates a fine-textured pattern of parallel ridges and valleys that channel water away from foot contact points and generate meaningful friction even on a saturated surface.\n\nAt Cloud Concrete of Seattle, we treat the broom finish not as a basic default but as a craft in itself. The quality of a broom finish is determined entirely by timing and technique. The concrete must be at exactly the right stage of set — firm enough that the broom creates clean, sharp ridges without the surface material pulling or tearing, but not so stiff that the broom skips across the top without penetrating. This window can be as narrow as 20 minutes on a warm summer day or as wide as two hours on a cool, overcast October morning. Reading the concrete and knowing when to execute the broom pass is a skill developed through hundreds of pours, and it is the difference between a finish with crisp, consistent texture and one with irregular, torn ridges that look sloppy and wear unevenly.\n\nThe broom direction matters as well. For walkways and sidewalks, we pull the broom perpendicular to the direction of travel, creating ridges that run side to side across the path. This orientation maximizes the traction benefit because the foot contacts multiple ridges with every step rather than aligning with a single groove. For driveway approaches, we broom parallel to the direction of travel so that tire contact is consistent and symmetrical. On sloped surfaces, we broom across the slope so that water drains across the ridges rather than channeling along them.\n\nBroom finish concrete is the most cost-effective finishing option available, and it pairs beautifully with any architectural style. The clean, uniform texture of a freshly broomed slab has a quiet professionalism that does not compete with the house or the landscape — it simply provides the right surface in the right place. In traditional Seattle neighborhoods like Wallingford, Fremont, and Phinney Ridge, where craftsman bungalows and Foursquares set the architectural tone, broom finish is the natural complement to classic wooden porch railings and Pacific Northwest plantings.\n\nFor homeowners who want to add visual interest to a broom finish surface without the cost of a fully decorative finish, we offer several enhancement options. A different broom texture in a border band around the perimeter of a driveway or patio creates a defined frame effect with no color difference. Saw-cut pattern lines in a grid or diagonal configuration add geometric interest while serving the functional purpose of control joints. A light sandblast treatment after curing opens the surface texture slightly and gives a slightly warmer, more natural appearance.\n\nFor all exterior applications including driveways, sidewalks, patios, steps, and commercial flatwork, we recommend following the broom finish with a penetrating concrete sealer to close the surface pores against moisture infiltration and extend the life of the surface significantly. Call us at (206) 495-0997 to discuss your project and get a free estimate — broom finish work is typically our most efficiently scheduled service, with most residential pours completable in a single day.",

    shortDescription: "High-gloss, industrial-strength interior flooring for modern Seattle homes.",
    longDescription: "Polished concrete has moved from the domain of industrial warehouses into the interiors of some of Seattle's most carefully designed homes and commercial spaces, and for reasons that have nothing to do with trend-following. It is simply one of the most functionally superior flooring options available for the Pacific Northwest climate, and its visual qualities — that deep, reflective sheen that seems to pull ambient light down from the ceiling and distribute it evenly across the floor — have made it the signature material of a generation of designers working in the contemporary Pacific Northwest aesthetic.\n\nThe polishing process begins with diamond grinding, using a sequence of progressively finer diamond tooling attached to a heavy floor grinder to mechanically refine the concrete surface. The process typically starts with a coarse-grit tool — 30 or 50 grit — to cut through any surface contamination, curing compounds, or surface irregularities and establish a clean, flat substrate. Each subsequent pass uses a finer grit: 100, 200, 400, 800, and finally 1,500 or 3,000 grit for the highest gloss levels. Between passes, we apply a concrete densifier — typically a lithium or sodium silicate compound — that penetrates into the surface and reacts with the calcium hydroxide in the concrete to fill pores and create additional crystalline structure within the top layer of the slab. This densification step is what gives polished concrete its characteristic hardness and its ability to resist surface abrasion that would quickly dull other floor finishes.\n\nThe gloss level specification determines the final appearance and is chosen based on the design intent. A salt-and-pepper grind at 400 grit produces a matte finish that is practical, non-reflective, and comfortable for high-traffic areas. A cream polish at 800 grit begins to show significant reflectivity and is popular for retail and hospitality spaces. A full-aggregate, high-gloss finish at 3,000 grit — where the polishing has cut deep enough to expose the aggregate stones within the concrete mix — produces a floor that looks like terrazzo or cut stone and reflects light with an almost liquid quality. For Seattle homes with generous south-facing windows and those characteristic gray-sky days when interior light sources matter enormously, this reflectivity transforms the livability of a space in a way that no other flooring material can match.\n\nColor enhancement is achieved through integral stains, water-based dyes, or reactive metallic pigments applied between grinding passes. These colorants penetrate the densified concrete pores and produce effects ranging from subtle warm gray variations that mimic natural stone to vivid, jewel-toned accents that become design statements in their own right. Seattle's design culture tends toward the former — restrained, nature-inspired tones that complement the exposed wood, raw steel, and natural stone that define the contemporary Pacific Northwest interior vocabulary.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, polished concrete is one of the most low-maintenance flooring options a homeowner can choose. It does not harbor allergens, does not require waxing or stripping, and cleans easily with a neutral-pH cleaner and a damp mop. For homes in Seattle where outdoor mud and wet shoes are a daily reality nine months of the year, a floor that wipes clean without absorbing contamination is a significant quality-of-life improvement. Polished concrete is also thermally compatible with in-floor radiant heating systems, which are increasingly common in new Seattle construction and ADU builds.\n\nWe recommend polished concrete for living areas, kitchens, open-plan great rooms, and commercial interiors including restaurants, retail spaces, and office environments. Pair it with area rugs to add acoustic softness and visual warmth in seating areas.

    shortDescription: "Professional-grade sealing to protect your concrete from moisture and stains.",
    longDescription: "Concrete is a remarkably durable material, but it is not impermeable. Fresh concrete is riddled with a network of capillary pores — microscopic channels formed by the water that was mixed into the cement paste during production. As the concrete cures and those water molecules migrate out of the matrix, the capillaries they leave behind remain as open pathways connecting the surface to the interior of the slab. In a dry climate, these pores are largely inconsequential. In Seattle, where the average year brings 37 inches of rainfall, freeze-thaw events in winter, significant atmospheric humidity year-round, and road salt exposure in winter months, those open pores represent the primary pathway through which concrete degrades.\n\nWater infiltration through concrete pores causes damage in multiple ways simultaneously. In freezing temperatures, water that has entered the pores expands by approximately nine percent as it freezes, generating internal pressure that exceeds the tensile strength of the concrete matrix. Over repeated freeze-thaw cycles — and Seattle's winter does cycle above and below freezing multiple times per season — this pressure fractures the surface layer from within, producing the spalling and scaling that makes older unprotected driveways look like they are shedding their skin. On slabs that were salted for ice control, the damage is accelerated further because salt lowers the freezing point of water and increases the frequency and violence of the freeze-thaw cycle within the concrete.\n\nBeyond freeze-thaw damage, moisture infiltration enables the chemical degradation of reinforcing steel. When water and oxygen reach the rebar embedded within a concrete slab, they initiate corrosion. Corroding steel expands, generating outward pressure within the concrete that eventually cracks and delaminates the cover concrete above the rebar. This is the mechanism behind the distinctive horizontal cracking and spalling seen on the edges of old Seattle sidewalks and bridge decks. A quality sealer on the surface above the steel dramatically slows the rate of moisture and oxygen ingress to the level where reinforcement corrosion becomes essentially negligible over the life of the structure.\n\nAt Cloud Concrete of Seattle, we work with two primary sealer categories depending on the application. Penetrating sealers — silane, siloxane, or silane-siloxane blends — are absorbed into the concrete pores rather than forming a film on the surface. They react with the concrete chemistry to create a hydrophobic lining within each capillary channel that repels liquid water while allowing water vapor to escape. This breathability is critical for slabs with subsurface moisture, as a non-breathable film sealer over such a slab can trap vapor pressure and cause delamination. Penetrating sealers are our default recommendation for driveways, sidewalks, and any exterior flatwork that was not poured with a decorative finish requiring gloss enhancement.\n\nFilm-forming sealers — acrylics, polyurethanes, and epoxies — sit on top of the concrete surface and create a protective barrier that enhances gloss, enriches color, and provides excellent resistance to oil stains, tire marks, and chemical spills. These sealers are the right choice for stamped and colored concrete where maintaining visual vibrancy is a priority, and for garage floors and commercial surfaces where chemical resistance is the primary functional requirement. High-solids acrylic sealers with UV inhibitors are our standard specification for decorative exterior work, as they maintain color saturation and resist the fading that UV exposure accelerates in pigmented concrete.\n\nWe recommend professional re-sealing every three to five years for exterior surfaces under normal Seattle weather exposure, and every five to seven years for protected interior slabs. The investment in regular sealing is the single most cost-effective maintenance action a concrete owner can take — far less expensive than repairing the spalling, staining, or corrosion damage that results from leaving the surface unprotected.

A colored concrete driveway, patio, or walkway immediately elevates the visual character of a property in a way that no other single upgrade can match — it changes not just the surface itself but the entire tonal relationship between the hardscape, the house, and the surrounding landscape. At Cloud Concrete of Seattle, we work extensively with colored concrete because we have seen, again and again, what the right color choice does to a property's curb appeal and the owners' daily relationship with their outdoor space.\n\nIntegral color is our primary method for most residential applications, and it is by far the most durable coloring approach available. Integral pigments are dry or liquid colorants that are blended directly into the concrete mix at the batch plant before the truck is loaded. This means the color is distributed uniformly throughout the full depth of the slab — not just applied to the surface. A four-inch colored slab is colored all the way through. When a surface chip or scratch occurs — which is inevitable over the lifetime of any concrete surface — the exposed concrete beneath matches the surrounding surface precisely. There is no base gray showing through, no patch that stands out. This through-body color is the fundamental reason integral coloring is the preferred method for driveways, pool decks, and any high-traffic surface where surface wear is expected.\n\nThe Pacific Northwest landscape provides a strong palette cue for colored concrete design in Seattle. The region's visual character is built on deep forest greens, the gray-blue of Puget Sound, warm cedar browns, and the charcoal volcanic rock that appears throughout the Cascade foothills. Our most frequently specified integral colors reflect this palette: Buff and Desert Tan warm a property without making it feel out of place among the evergreens; Slate Gray and Charcoal complement the dark rooflines and natural stone details common in contemporary Seattle construction; Brick Red and Terracotta bring warmth to craftsman bungalows in Wallingford, Fremont, and the Central District; and Santa Fe or Autumn Leaf tones add richness to backyard patios that need to feel welcoming through the gray months of winter.\n\nIntegral color works in combination with surface treatments to produce effects of extraordinary depth and realism. When we apply an antique release agent over integral-colored concrete before stamping, we create a two-tone effect where the base color shows through the high points of the pattern and a darker secondary tone settles into the low points, exactly replicating the light-and-shadow play of genuine natural stone. The result is a concrete surface that most observers genuinely cannot distinguish from hand-laid material.\n\nFor existing concrete that a homeowner wants to color without replacement, acid staining offers a permanent and beautiful alternative. Acid stains react chemically with the concrete surface to create variegated, translucent color effects that have an organic quality integral color cannot replicate. The inherent variation in each slab's mineral content means that acid-stained floors look genuinely unique, like cut stone or aged marble, with no two being identical. Water-based stains and concrete dyes offer a more predictable, uniform result for situations where the organic variation of acid staining is not the desired aesthetic.\n\nRegardless of the coloring method, every colored concrete surface we install is protected with a high-performance UV-resistant sealer that locks the color in and prevents the fading that unprotected exterior concrete experiences within the first few Seattle summers. We also offer re-sealing services to refresh the protection layer and restore the color vibrancy of older decorated surfaces. Call us at (206) 495-0997 for a free consultation and to see our color sample boards — choosing the right color for your property is much easier when you can see the options in natural light at your own site.",

    shortDescription: "Expertly crafted concrete stairs for safe and beautiful property access.",
    longDescription: "In Seattle, where the terrain rolls and drops across every neighborhood from Queen Anne Hill to Beacon Hill to the forested slopes of West Seattle, steps and stairs are not optional features — they are the primary means of moving between the street and the front door, between the deck and the garden, between a tiered backyard and the house. They are also the most trafficked concrete surface on most properties, the one that every visitor contacts multiple times on every visit, and the one that receives the harshest combination of daily foot traffic and Pacific Northwest weather exposure. Getting them right in the first place is not just an aesthetic matter. It is a safety matter, a code compliance matter, and a long-term investment in your property's value and livability.\n\nAt Cloud Concrete of Seattle, concrete step work is one of our most technically demanding services, and one we approach with particular care. The dimensional requirements for safe, comfortable stairs are governed by the Seattle Residential Building Code, which follows IBC standards specifying a maximum riser height of 7-3/4 inches, a minimum tread depth of 10 inches, and a maximum variation of 3/8 inch between any two risers in a single flight. These dimensional tolerances exist because human gait calibrates unconsciously to the rhythm of a stair — even a minor inconsistency in riser height creates a stumble hazard that the owner and visitors will never consciously identify but will trigger on every descent. We measure, form, and pour every stair flight to hold within 1/8 inch on all critical dimensions.\n\nThe structural build of a concrete stair begins with the supporting form work. Steps are cantilevered structures or supported on grade, and in either case, the formwork must be rigid enough to resist the significant pressure of wet concrete without deflecting. We build our forms from high-grade plywood and steel hardware, checking every dimension before the pour begins. For entry stairs with more than four risers, or for any stair set on a sloped or excavated site, we engineer a reinforced concrete base structure to ensure the stairs cannot settle or rotate over time even as Seattle's clay soils cycle through wet and dry seasons.\n\nRebar reinforcement is critical in stair construction because concrete stairs are subject to both vertical load and the horizontal shear forces generated by foot traffic and thermal cycling. We install a minimum of two horizontal bars at the nose of each tread and vertical bars connecting each tread-riser junction, using Grade 60 steel tied at each intersection. For wider stairs or those supporting heavy public use, we increase the steel schedule accordingly. The concrete mix for step work is a 4,000 PSI air-entrained mix, specified to balance workability in the complex form geometry with the low water-to-cement ratio needed for long-term durability and freeze-thaw resistance.\n\nFinishing is where safety and aesthetics converge. For exterior stairs in Seattle's climate, the broom finish is the baseline requirement — a standard that no decorative finish should compromise. We pull the broom perpendicular to the direction of travel on each tread, creating ridges that maximize grip for wet shoe soles. For homeowners who want a more refined appearance, we can apply a stamped pattern to the riser faces while maintaining a textured tread surface, creating visual interest without sacrificing traction. Exposed aggregate finishing is another excellent option for exterior stairs, providing both exceptional grip and a naturally beautiful appearance that weathers gracefully over decades.\n\nAfter installation, concrete steps benefit significantly from professional sealing that locks out moisture and prevents the scaling and spalling that would otherwise develop within a few winters. For historic properties in Capitol Hill, Queen Anne, or the University District where matching existing concrete is important, we offer color-matching consultation and custom mix specifications that bring new stairs into visual harmony with surrounding original concrete. Call us at (206) 495-0997 for a free on-site estimate. We will measure your grade change, review any code requirements for your specific application, and design a stair solution that is safe, code-compliant, durable, and as visually refined as your property deserves.",

    answer: "For professional installation in 2025, homeowners can typically expect to pay between $12 and $22 per square foot, depending on the thickness, reinforcement, and finishing choices. Site accessibility and the need for slope stabilization can also impact the final price."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does concrete take to cure in Seattle's climate?",
    answer: "Initial set occurs within 24 hours, meaning you can walk on it with light shoes. However, curing takes 28 days to reach full structural strength. We recommend waiting 7 days before driving standard vehicles on a new pour, and 14-21 days for heavy trucks or equipment."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you handle the permitting process with the City of Seattle?",
    answer: "Yes, for most structural projects and work within the public right-of-way (like sidewalks), we manage the entire permit application and inspection scheduling process with SDOT and DPD to ensure your project is fully compliant."
  },
  {
    question: "Is stamped concrete slippery when wet?",
    answer: "While any smooth surface can be slippery when wet, we add specialized slip-resistant shark-grip additives to our sealers to ensure that even highly decorative stamped surfaces remain safe and walkable during Seattle's frequent rainy months."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the best time of year to pour concrete in Washington?",
    answer: "While we can pour year-round using specific weather admixtures, the most ideal window is between mid-April and early October. During winter, we monitor humidity and temperature closely to ensure the hydration process is not interrupted by frost or excessive saturation."
  },
  {
    question: "Why does concrete crack, and can it be prevented?",
    answer: "Concrete naturally shrinks as it cures, which can cause minor hairline cracks. We prevent significant cracking by using precision-cut expansion joints, heavy-duty rebar reinforcement, and high-quality subgrade compaction. We also use fiber-reinforced mixes for extra tensile strength."
