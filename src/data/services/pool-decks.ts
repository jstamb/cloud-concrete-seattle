      title: "Slip-Resistant Surfaces Engineered for Safety",
      description: "Wet concrete around a pool becomes a genuine hazard when left with a standard smooth finish. Our pool deck installations use broom-finished, exposed-aggregate, or textured stamped patterns specifically chosen for their coefficient of friction when wet — the same standard applied to commercial aquatic facilities. Every square foot of deck adjacent to the pool coping is designed so bare feet grip the surface rather than slide, protecting the people who matter most."

    {
      title: "Cool-Deck Coatings That Reduce Surface Temperature",
      description: "Standard gray concrete in full sun can reach 140–160°F on a warm Seattle summer day, making the walk from the house to the pool an exercise in pain tolerance. Our cool-deck coatings use a light-reflective aggregate and a proprietary formulation that keeps surface temperatures 30–40 degrees cooler than uncoated concrete. Seattle summers are increasingly warm and dry, and a cool-deck surface extends the comfortable hours you can actually use your outdoor space."
    },
    {
      title: "Custom Aesthetics Matched to Your Home",
      description: "A concrete pool deck need not look like a municipal facility. We offer stamped patterns that replicate natural stone, slate, travertine, and wood plank, paired with integral or applied color systems in dozens of hues. Whether your home's architecture is mid-century modern in Laurelhurst, craftsman bungalow in Madrona, or contemporary in South Lake Union, we design a deck surface that reads as intentional and custom rather than utilitarian. Decorative concrete and colored concrete options can be combined for a truly unique finish."
    },
    {
      title: "Structural Durability Through Seattle's Wet Seasons",
      description: "Pool decks endure a unique combination of stresses: constant moisture from splashing, pool chemicals, freeze-thaw cycles, and heavy foot traffic from wet feet that track grit across the surface all season. We design pool decks with a minimum 4,000 PSI air-entrained concrete mix reinforced with rebar or fiber mesh, and we slope all deck sections a minimum of 1/8 inch per foot away from the pool bond beam to drain surface water efficiently. This prevents ponding that degrades concrete and fosters algae growth on the deck surface."
    },
    {
      title: "Chemical and UV Resistance with Professional Sealing",
      description: "Pool water — whether chlorinated or salt-water — contains chemicals that attack unprotected concrete over time, etching the surface and promoting efflorescence. Our pool deck installations include a penetrating silane-siloxane sealer as a base layer to resist chlorine and chemical splash, topped with an acrylic or polyurethane topcoat calibrated for the right level of sheen and additional slip resistance. Annual resealing, which we also offer as a maintenance service, keeps the protective system intact through years of seasonal use."
    },
    {
      title: "Seamless Integration with Pool Coping and Surrounding Hardscape",
      description: "A pool deck that doesn't integrate with the surrounding patio, walkways, and landscaping looks incomplete. We coordinate pool deck work with your concrete patios, retaining walls, and concrete steps so materials, colors, and textures flow cohesively across the entire outdoor living space. This holistic approach adds significant curb appeal and resale value, transforming what could be a utilitarian concrete apron into a genuinely resort-quality outdoor environment."

    {
      step: "01",
      title: "Site Assessment and Design Consultation",
      description: "We visit the property to assess existing conditions: pool shell type (gunite, fiberglass, vinyl liner), existing deck or hardscape to be removed or matched, drainage patterns, and any grade changes needed to achieve positive drainage away from the pool. We photograph the site, take measurements, and review any HOA design guidelines or City of Seattle permit requirements for pool-related structures. The consultation concludes with a preliminary design sketch and material samples so you can visualize the finished result before committing."
    },
    {
      step: "02",
      title: "Demolition, Grading, and Subbase Preparation",
      description: "Existing pool decking — whether deteriorated concrete, pavers, or wood — is removed and hauled away. The subgrade is excavated to the design depth (typically 6–8 inches below finish grade for a 4-inch slab over a 3–4-inch compacted gravel subbase), and the soil is graded to establish the drainage slope away from the pool before any base material is placed. Seattle's clay soils often require over-excavation and replacement with angular crushed rock rather than native material to prevent settling, a step we assess during the site visit and build into the scope of work."
    },
    {
      step: "03",
      title: "Forming, Reinforcement, and Expansion Joint Layout",
      description: "Perimeter forms are set to establish the finished deck elevation and slope. Rebar (typically #4 at 18 inches on center) or fiber mesh is placed on chairs to position the steel at mid-depth of the slab. Expansion joint material is installed between the deck and pool coping, and between deck panels exceeding approximately 10 feet in any dimension, to accommodate thermal movement without cracking. Control joints are planned on the formwork so they align aesthetically with the stamped pattern if decorative work is being performed."
    },
    {
      step: "04",
      title: "Concrete Placement and Decorative Finishing",
      description: "We pour a minimum 4,000 PSI air-entrained mix — air entrainment is critical for freeze-thaw resistance, even in Seattle's mild climate — and strike off to grade before the initial finishing sequence. For stamped work, color hardener is broadcast and troweled in, release agent is applied, and stamps are pressed into the concrete in the agreed pattern and orientation while the mix remains plastic. For broom or exposed-aggregate finishes, the surface is finished by hand, and for cool-deck applications, the proprietary coating is applied to the freshly floated concrete and textured before set."
    },
    {
      step: "05",
      title: "Curing, Sealing, and Final Inspection",
      description: "Concrete is cured for a minimum of seven days — we use a curing compound applied immediately after finishing to prevent moisture loss during this critical period, essential in Seattle's variable summer weather where a warm afternoon can be followed by a cool marine-layer evening that disrupts curing rate. After the curing period, the slab is cleaned, any grout lines or accent colors are applied for stamped work, and the specified sealer system is applied in two coats. We walk the completed deck with you, explain the maintenance schedule, and provide a written care guide."

    title: "Complete Pool Deck Replacement with Travertine-Pattern Stamping",
    neighborhood: "Laurelhurst",
    projectType: "Residential Pool Deck Resurfacing and Replacement",
    challenge: "A Laurelhurst homeowner with a classic 1970s in-ground pool had an original concrete deck that had cracked extensively across multiple panels, with one section near the diving board area settled nearly an inch below the pool coping. The existing deck surface was smooth, dangerously slippery when wet, and stained from decades of pool chemical exposure. The homeowner wanted a resort-style aesthetic to match a recently remodeled home exterior, but needed a surface that could handle the Pacific Northwest's cool, wet shoulder seasons without deteriorating.",
    solution: "We removed the entire 850-square-foot existing deck and re-graded the subbase, adding six inches of compacted crushed rock in the settled corner to correct the drainage issue before forming. The replacement deck was poured at 4 inches thick with 4,500 PSI air-entrained concrete and #4 rebar on 18-inch centers. We applied a Roman travertine stamped pattern in a warm buff base with a charcoal antiquing release, matching the home's new fiber-cement siding tones. A double-broadcast color hardener system created the color variation characteristic of natural travertine. All surfaces within six feet of the pool edge received a cross-broom texture overlay on the stamped face for maximum slip resistance.",
    result: "The completed deck transformed the pool area into a cohesive outdoor living space that the homeowner described as 'looking like we imported stone from a resort.' The cool-toned sealer chosen reduced the surface temperature noticeably compared to the old gray concrete on the first warm day after completion. Two seasons later, the deck has shown no cracking, no re-settlement, and the color remains vivid with annual resealing. The homeowner received multiple unsolicited compliments from neighbors and attributed a strong appraisal result to the outdoor space improvements."

  faqs: [
    {
      question: "What is the best concrete finish for a pool deck in the Seattle area?",
      answer: "For Seattle's climate and lifestyle, we most often recommend either a textured stamped concrete pattern or an exposed-aggregate finish for pool decks. Stamped concrete offers design flexibility and can replicate stone or tile aesthetics at a lower cost than natural materials, while exposed aggregate provides a naturally slip-resistant surface without requiring additional texture application. Both options should be sealed with a non-slip additive incorporated into the topcoat sealer. Smooth troweled or standard broom finishes are generally not appropriate for pool deck surfaces adjacent to the water's edge because they become too slippery when wet. Cool-deck coatings are an excellent addition to either base finish for maximizing comfort during Seattle's increasingly warm summer days."
    },
    {
      question: "Does my pool deck require a permit from the City of Seattle?",
      answer: "In most cases, replacing or installing a concrete pool deck requires a building permit from Seattle's Department of Construction and Inspections (SDCI), particularly if the deck is structurally attached to the pool shell or if any grading work is involved. Projects in Seattle's shoreline zones — including properties near Lake Washington in neighborhoods like Laurelhurst, Windermere, and Seward Park — may also require a Shoreline Substantial Development Permit if the project exceeds a threshold cost. Cloud Concrete handles the permit application process as part of larger pool deck projects and coordinates inspections so work proceeds without compliance gaps. We review permit requirements during the initial site consultation."
    },
    {
      question: "How long will a new concrete pool deck last in Seattle's climate?",
      answer: "A properly designed and installed concrete pool deck in the Seattle area should last 25–40 years before requiring major structural work. The key variables that determine longevity are: concrete mix design (air-entrained concrete resists freeze-thaw damage), drainage slope (ponding water accelerates deterioration), the sealing program (a resealed deck every 2–3 years maintains chemical and moisture resistance), and the quality of expansion joint materials (flexible joint filler prevents water intrusion at the pool coping interface). Seattle's climate is relatively mild — we do not experience the extreme freeze-thaw frequency of colder climates — which is actually an advantage for pool deck longevity compared to, say, the Midwest. The biggest threat to pool decks here is persistent moisture infiltration combined with pool chemical exposure if the sealing program lapses."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you resurface my existing pool deck instead of replacing it?",
      answer: "Yes, if the existing concrete slab is structurally sound — meaning it has not settled significantly, does not have full-depth cracks across multiple panels, and has adequate thickness — resurfacing with a microtopography overlay or a stamped overlay system is an excellent option that costs roughly 40–60% of full replacement. We apply a polymer-modified overlay at 1/4 to 3/8 inch thickness over the prepared existing slab, which can be stamped, stained, and sealed to achieve a completely transformed appearance. The critical prerequisite is a thorough assessment of the existing slab's bond potential — we core the slab and perform a tensile bond test to confirm the overlay will adhere — and any areas with active water infiltration or settlement must be addressed first. Call us at (206) 495-0997 to schedule a condition assessment."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does a concrete pool deck cost in Seattle?",
      answer: "Pool deck pricing in Seattle varies considerably based on size, finish complexity, demolition scope, and drainage requirements. A basic broom-finished replacement deck runs approximately $8–$12 per square foot installed, while stamped concrete pool decks with color and texture work typically range from $14–$22 per square foot. Resurfacing an existing structurally sound deck with a decorative overlay runs $6–$14 per square foot depending on the overlay system and pattern complexity. Cool-deck coatings add approximately $2–$4 per square foot to any base finish. Permit fees, if required, are an additional cost typically ranging from $500–$2,500 depending on project scope. We provide detailed written estimates with no hidden costs after the initial site visit."

  localContext: "Seattle's pool season is shorter than in Southern California or Arizona, but homeowners across the city take their backyard pools seriously — investing in resort-quality outdoor spaces that extend usable time as much as possible into the cool spring and fall shoulder seasons. Neighborhoods like Laurelhurst, Windermere, Madison Park, and Madrona along Lake Washington have some of the highest concentrations of in-ground pools in the city, and the mature landscaping and craftsman or mid-century architecture in these areas demands pool deck designs that complement the broader property character rather than clash with it. We have completed pool deck projects throughout these lakeside neighborhoods and understand the design sensibility that prevails.\n\nThe Seattle climate presents specific engineering considerations for pool decks that don't apply in drier climates. The combination of pool splash, rainfall, and the mild but persistent freeze-thaw cycles experienced during Seattle winters means that pool deck concrete must be designed for moisture resistance from the outset. We specify air-entrained concrete with a water-to-cement ratio below 0.45 for all pool deck work, and we insist on positive drainage slopes — a minimum 1/8 inch per foot away from the pool bond beam — on every project. Seattle's glacial-till soils also have varying bearing capacity, and we conduct subbase assessments on every pool deck project to determine whether native soil is adequate or whether imported crushed rock is needed to prevent differential settlement.\n\nBeyond the technical requirements, Seattle homeowners who invest in pool deck renovations typically do so as part of broader outdoor living improvements that may include adjacent concrete patios, concrete steps leading from the house, retaining walls managing grade transitions, and landscape curbing defining planting beds. Cloud Concrete's capability across all of these concrete disciplines means we can serve as the single contractor for the entire outdoor concrete scope, ensuring material consistency, color coordination, and seamless transitions between functional areas of the yard. Call us at (206) 495-0997 to discuss your complete outdoor vision."

  maintenanceTips: [
    "Reseal your concrete pool deck every two to three years with a penetrating sealer followed by a UV-resistant acrylic or polyurethane topcoat containing a non-slip aggregate additive to maintain both chemical resistance and surface grip.",
    "Inspect expansion joints between the deck and pool coping each spring and replace any cracked or missing joint filler with a flexible polyurethane caulk rated for pool environments to prevent water infiltration and edge cracking.",
    "Rinse the pool deck surface with fresh water after heavy pool chemical use or after applying any pool shock treatments, as undiluted chlorine or acid splash left on unsealed concrete will etch and discolor the surface over time.",
    "Power-wash the deck at the start of each pool season using a fan-tip nozzle at no more than 2,000 PSI to remove algae and mineral deposits without damaging the sealer surface or dislodging aggregate from the finish.",
    "Monitor any large shade trees adjacent to the pool deck for root growth toward the slab edge; tree roots can lift and crack concrete panels over time, and early-stage lifting caught at a quarter-inch or less can be addressed with concrete leveling rather than replacement."

  whyChooseUs: "Cloud Concrete of Seattle approaches every pool deck project as a precision engineering exercise combined with a design collaboration. Our crews have completed pool deck installations and resurfacing projects across dozens of Seattle neighborhoods, giving us direct experience with the soil conditions, drainage challenges, and design vocabularies that characterize different parts of the city. We bring stamped pattern samples, color chip systems, and sealer sheen samples to every initial consultation so you can make informed decisions with physical materials in hand rather than guessing from a website photo.\n\nOur technical standards exceed the minimums for pool deck construction. We use air-entrained concrete mixes as standard on all pool decks — not an upgrade — because Seattle's winters, though mild, include enough freeze-thaw cycling to damage non-air-entrained concrete over time. We place expansion joints wherever required by thermal movement calculations, not just where they are convenient. Our drainage grading is confirmed with a four-foot level after pour, not estimated by eye. These details are invisible once the deck is complete, but they are what separates a deck that looks beautiful for 30 years from one that begins cracking and spalling within five.\n\nWe also back our pool deck installations with a written warranty covering structural defects and stand behind our color and finish work. Call Cloud Concrete of Seattle at (206) 495-0997 to schedule your free site consultation and design session. We serve the entire Seattle metropolitan area and can typically accommodate initial consultations within a week."
