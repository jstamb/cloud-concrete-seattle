      title: "Engineered Drainage for Year-Round Usability",
      description:
        "A patio that pools water is useless in Seattle's rainy season — and Seattle's rainy season is nine months long. Every patio we design incorporates a minimum 1.5% slope toward a designated drainage outlet, whether that is a lawn edge, a permeable gravel border, or a concealed drain tied into the property's storm system. Proper drainage engineering is the difference between a patio you use every dry day and one you avoid until June.",

      title: "Finish Options from Classic to Contemporary",
      description:
        "A concrete patio is a blank canvas. We offer broom finish for a traditional non-slip texture, salt finish for a subtle pebbled surface, exposed aggregate for a natural stone aesthetic, stamped patterns for decorative visual interest, and modern polished concrete for an interior-grade look on covered outdoor spaces. We help you choose the finish that complements your home's architecture and the way you plan to use the space.",

    {
      title: "Structural Integrity Through Seattle's Wet Winters",
      description:
        "Concrete patios fail prematurely in the Pacific Northwest when subgrade preparation is inadequate and water accumulates beneath the slab, causing freeze-thaw heaving or differential settling in clay-rich soils. We excavate fully, install a compacted crushed-rock base, and use a fiber-reinforced 4,000 PSI mix on every patio regardless of size. The result is a slab that remains flat and crack-free through decades of Seattle's seasonal saturation cycles.",
    },
    {
      title: "Seamless Integration with Outdoor Living Design",
      description:
        "We coordinate with landscape designers, outdoor kitchen contractors, and pergola builders to ensure your patio is poured with the correct embed plates, conduit sleeves, and structural thickening at post locations before the concrete sets. Planning these integrations in advance eliminates costly saw-cutting after the fact. Your patio becomes the permanent, load-bearing foundation for the entire outdoor living environment you are creating.",
    },
    {
      title: "Low Maintenance in a High-Moisture Environment",
      description:
        "Seattle's combination of moss, algae, fallen leaves, and persistent moisture can make natural stone and wood decking into maintenance nightmares. Sealed concrete resists biological growth, cleans with a hose and occasional mild detergent, and does not rot, splinter, or require annual staining the way pressure-treated wood does. A concrete patio delivers the outdoor living surface you want without the annual upkeep commitment that other materials demand.",

    {
      title: "Permeable Options for Seattle Stormwater Compliance",
      description:
        "Seattle's stormwater regulations increasingly favor permeable surfaces for new hardscape additions. We offer pervious concrete as a patio option for projects where SDCI stormwater compliance is required or where the homeowner wants to reduce runoff to the city system. Pervious concrete looks similar to a salt finish, allows rainwater to pass through the slab, and qualifies as a low-impact development (LID) practice under Seattle's green stormwater infrastructure standards.",

      title: "Outdoor Living Consultation and Layout Design",
      description:
        "We visit your property to discuss your vision for the space — entertaining layout, furniture placement, connection to the house, relationship to the garden. We measure the area, identify drainage paths, and note any obstacles such as tree roots, utility lines, or grade changes. By the end of the consultation, we have a preliminary layout sketch, a finish recommendation, and a written estimate for your review.",

      description:
        "We call 811 to locate underground utilities before breaking ground, and we coordinate with any co-contractors — electricians for patio lighting conduit, plumbers for gas lines to outdoor kitchens — to ensure their rough-in work is complete before we pour. If the project involves new impervious surface additions that trigger Seattle's stormwater review threshold, we identify the requirement early and advise on options including permeable concrete.",

      title: "Demolition, Excavation, and Base Compaction",
      description:
        "Existing surfacing — old concrete, pavers, sod, or decomposed gravel — is removed and hauled away. The sub-base is excavated to the designed depth, typically 6 inches for a 4-inch slab plus 2-inch base, and a plate compactor is run in multiple lifts to achieve a firm, stable foundation. Any soft spots or organic inclusions found during excavation are removed and backfilled with crushed rock before forming begins.",

      title: "Forming, Reinforcement, and Concrete Placement",
      description:
        "Forms are set to the designed slope and perimeter shape, including any curved edges or radius corners. Embed sleeves, conduit, and post brackets are installed in the formwork before the pour. Fiber-reinforced colored or standard concrete is placed, consolidated with a screed and bull float, and finished to the selected texture. Control joints are tooled or saw-cut to manage crack placement predictably.",

      description:
        "A curing compound is applied immediately after finishing to protect the surface during the critical early hydration period, particularly important in Seattle's frequently cool and overcast conditions. After the 28-day design-strength cure, we return to apply a UV-stable sealer appropriate to the finish type. The project concludes with a thorough site cleanup, a walkthrough with the homeowner, and delivery of maintenance documentation.",

    title: "Multi-Level Stamped and Broom-Finish Patio in Phinney Ridge",
    neighborhood: "Phinney Ridge",
    projectType: "Residential Multi-Level Outdoor Patio",
    challenge:
      "A Phinney Ridge homeowner wanted to transform a steeply sloped backyard into a functional outdoor entertaining space with distinct zones for dining and lounging. The lot dropped nearly four feet across the 30-foot patio footprint, making a single-level pour impractical without major grading. The adjacent retaining wall — an aging railroad tie structure — was failing and needed to be incorporated into the overall project scope. Seattle's wet spring schedule gave the homeowner a narrow construction window.",
    solution:
      "Cloud Concrete of Seattle designed a two-level patio with an upper stamped concrete dining terrace and a lower broom-finish lounge area connected by two concrete steps. The failing retaining wall was demolished and replaced with a poured-in-place concrete wall that serves as the structural separation between the two levels, with a built-in seat cap providing additional seating. Both slab levels drain to a central channel drain that exits through the fence line to a rock infiltration trench. The project was sequenced to complete within a 14-day dry window in late April.",
    result:
      "The finished patio transformed an unusable slope into the primary gathering space for the family. The Roman cobblestone stamped upper terrace in a warm sandstone tone with antique brown release complements the home's 1920s Craftsman character, while the broom-finish lower area provides a durable surface for outdoor furniture. The new concrete retaining wall has addressed the structural failure definitively, and the drainage system keeps both levels dry and usable within hours of a rainstorm. The homeowners hosted their first outdoor dinner party the following summer — a milestone they said felt impossible before the project.",

    {
      question: "How much does a concrete patio cost in Seattle?",
      answer:
        "A standard broom-finish concrete patio in Seattle ranges from $7 to $12 per square foot installed. Decorative finishes add to the base cost: stamped concrete runs $14 to $20 per square foot, exposed aggregate $10 to $16, and colored concrete adds $2 to $4 per square foot. A typical 400-square-foot patio runs $2,800 to $4,800 for a broom finish or $5,600 to $8,000 for a stamped version. Multi-level designs, drainage structures, and difficult site access carry additional charges, which we itemize clearly in your written estimate.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need a permit to build a concrete patio in Seattle?",
      answer:
        "Patio slabs at or near grade on private property generally do not require a building permit in Seattle, but there are important exceptions. If your project adds more than 5,000 square feet of new impervious surface — unlikely for most residential patios — a drainage plan may be required. Raised patios over 30 inches from grade typically do require a structural permit. Projects in Seattle's Environmentally Critical Areas (ECAs), common near steep slopes and wetlands, require additional review. We assess permit requirements at the initial consultation and handle any required submittals.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I keep moss and algae off my concrete patio in Seattle?",
      answer:
        "Moss and algae growth is a universal Seattle outdoor surface challenge. The most effective prevention strategy is maintaining a good quality sealer on the concrete — sealed surfaces are less porous and give biological growth less to grip. Annual spring cleaning with a diluted sodium hypochlorite solution (1 part bleach to 10 parts water) kills existing growth without damaging the concrete or sealer. Trimming overhanging vegetation to allow more light and airflow also reduces growth significantly. We recommend adding a mild biocide to the final sealer coat in heavily shaded locations.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to build a concrete patio in Seattle?",
      answer:
        "Most residential concrete patio projects take 3 to 5 working days from mobilization to finished pour, depending on size and complexity. A simple 400-square-foot broom-finish patio on a prepared site might take 2 to 3 days. Multi-level designs with forming, drainage structures, and decorative finishes may run 5 to 7 days. Weather windows are a real factor in Seattle: we will not pour concrete when temperatures are below 35°F or when rain is forecast to fall on fresh concrete within 4 hours. We monitor weather forecasts closely and schedule pours during reliable windows.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can a concrete patio be added later to an existing landscape without disturbing plantings?",
      answer:
        "Yes, and this is one of the most common project types we handle in established Seattle gardens. We route mini-excavators and concrete trucks through existing landscape beds, use hand-digging near sensitive root zones of mature trees, and work in sections to minimize disturbance. We request your input on which plants and features are must-protect priorities before we begin. In tight spaces where standard equipment cannot reach, we have used concrete pumps to place material from the street, eliminating the need to drive equipment through the yard entirely.",
    },
  ],

  localContext:
    "Seattle homeowners invest heavily in outdoor living space because the city's famously beautiful summers — with long days, low humidity, and temperatures rarely exceeding 80°F — reward that investment with months of genuinely comfortable use. Neighborhoods like Madison Park, Madrona, and Leschi, where homes back up to spectacular views of Lake Washington, regularly feature resort-caliber patios designed to capture sightlines to the water and the Cascades. In these settings, a concrete patio is not merely a functional surface — it is an architectural element that anchors outdoor rooms with a fireplace, a water feature, and fully integrated outdoor kitchen concrete work.\n\nAt the same time, Seattle's practical climate realities shape patio design in important ways. The nine months of rainfall from October through June mean that drainage cannot be an afterthought. We have corrected more poorly-drained patios in Seattle than we care to count — slabs that technically satisfy the building code but pond water against the house foundation or create soggy garden borders that kill plantings. Our standard specification routes drainage proactively away from structures and toward permeable landscape areas or discrete drains, keeping the patio functional and the surrounding landscape healthy through Seattle's persistently wet shoulder seasons.\n\nSloped lots — a defining feature of Seattle geography from Beacon Hill to Phinney Ridge to the dramatic west face of Queen Anne — create both challenges and opportunities for patio design. A well-designed multi-level concrete patio on a sloped lot can transform an otherwise unusable backyard into a series of distinct outdoor rooms at different elevations, connected by concrete steps and retaining walls that double as seating. This kind of comprehensive outdoor transformation is a signature capability of Cloud Concrete of Seattle, developed through years of working on the Pacific Northwest's most demanding residential topography.",

  maintenanceTips: [
    "Sweep or blow leaves and organic debris off the patio surface weekly during fall — decomposing organic matter holds moisture and accelerates biological growth on even well-sealed concrete in Seattle's wet climate.",
    "Apply a fresh coat of UV-stable sealer every 3 years on exposed patios and every 4 to 5 years on covered patio sections that receive less direct weather exposure.",
    "Clean the patio with a mild pH-neutral concrete cleaner each spring to remove winter grime, algae residue, and tannin stains from fallen leaves before the outdoor living season begins.",
    "Inspect the perimeter expansion joint between the patio slab and the house foundation annually; keep it free of debris and filled with a flexible polyurethane sealant to prevent water from tracking under the slab.",
    "Avoid dragging heavy metal furniture across the patio surface — rubber feet on chair legs protect the sealer from abrasion and extend the interval between resealing cycles.",

  whyChooseUs:
    "A concrete patio is one of the most visible and most used improvements you will make to your home, and the quality of the finished product is entirely determined by the crew that builds it. Cloud Concrete of Seattle employs full-time finishing specialists — not seasonal laborers — who have spent years developing the surface-reading instincts that separate a flat, well-drained patio from a surface riddled with bird baths and surface pitting. We pour every patio to the same structural standard as a driveway or commercial slab: engineered base, proper reinforcement, correct mix design, and controlled curing.\n\nWe understand that your patio project almost never happens in isolation. It is typically part of a broader outdoor living renovation that involves landscape contractors, outdoor lighting electricians, and possibly structural changes to the home's rear elevation. We are practiced collaborators who coordinate schedules proactively, install all required conduit and embed hardware before the pour, and communicate clearly with your other co-contractors to keep the overall project moving. That project management competence is something our clients consistently cite in their reviews.\n\nCall (206) 495-0997 to schedule a free consultation at your property. We bring sample boards and completed project photos to the meeting so you can make confident aesthetic decisions in your actual yard, in Seattle's actual light. Our estimates are detailed line-item documents — not vague lump sums — so you understand exactly what you are paying for. We look forward to building you the outdoor living space you have been imagining.",
