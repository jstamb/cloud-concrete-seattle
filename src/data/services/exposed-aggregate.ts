      title: "Exceptional Wet-Weather Traction",
      description: "Exposed aggregate is unmatched among decorative concrete finishes for slip resistance in wet conditions—the very quality that makes it the go-to choice for driveways, walkways, and pool decks in the Pacific Northwest. Each individual stone protruding from the surface creates hundreds of micro-grip points that interrupt the water film beneath a shoe or tire, preventing hydroplaning and dramatically reducing the risk of slip-and-fall accidents. In a city where rain falls on more than 150 days per year, designing for wet-surface traction is not an aesthetic preference—it is a safety imperative.",
    },
    {
      title: "Natural Pacific Northwest Aesthetic",
      description: "The stones, pebbles, and gravels used in exposed aggregate concrete mirror the natural river rock and glacial materials that define the Pacific Northwest landscape—basalt, river gravel, and quartz blends complement the lush green gardens, cedar fencing, and natural timber aesthetics that characterize homes from Ballard to Seward Park. Unlike stamped concrete patterns that mimic other materials, exposed aggregate is authentically stone: real aggregate revealed from within the concrete matrix. The result is a surface that looks entirely at home in the PNW environment rather than transplanted from a Southwestern or Mediterranean design catalog.",
    },
    {
      title: "Hides Minor Blemishes and Weathering Gracefully",
      description: "One of exposed aggregate's most underappreciated practical advantages is its visual tolerance for weathering—the irregular, multi-toned surface of exposed river rock or crushed granite conceals minor surface staining, efflorescence, weathering, and seasonal discoloration that would be glaringly obvious on a plain broom-finished or colored concrete surface. This characteristic is particularly valuable in Seattle's wet climate, where airborne organic matter, moss, algae, and mineral deposits from rain are constantly present. The textured, variegated surface of exposed aggregate ages attractively and is far more forgiving over decades of PNW weather than smoother decorative alternatives.",
    },
    {
      title: "Aggregate Customization for Every Design",
      description: "Exposed aggregate is not a single look—it is a canvas for design. We source aggregates ranging from fine pea gravel and rounded river cobbles to angular crushed basalt, quartzite, marble chips, and decorative glass in a full spectrum of colors. Aggregate size, color, and density can be tuned to complement any home exterior palette, from the warm earth tones of a Craftsman bungalow to the cool grays and whites of a contemporary home in South Lake Union. We offer aggregate samples for client review during the design process so you can visualize the finished surface before a single cubic yard of concrete is poured.",
    },
    {
      title: "Durability Comparable to Standard Concrete",
      description: "Exposed aggregate concrete carries the same structural durability as any other concrete flatwork when properly designed and installed—the aggregate exposure process does not weaken the slab matrix if performed at the correct time with the correct techniques. A well-installed exposed aggregate driveway or patio will provide 25 to 40 years of structural service in Seattle's climate when sealed regularly and maintained properly. The aggregate-rich surface layer is often more abrasion-resistant than the smooth paste surface of conventional concrete, since aggregate materials like basalt, granite, and quartz are harder than hardened cement paste.",
    },
    {
      title: "Seamless Integration with Natural Landscaping",
      description: "Exposed aggregate surfaces transition naturally to surrounding landscape elements—river rock borders, natural stone retaining walls, boulder placements, and gravel garden beds—in a way that plain concrete or even stamped concrete often cannot match. This makes exposed aggregate an ideal surface for properties where the landscaping is a primary design feature, such as the elaborate garden estates found in neighborhoods like Windermere, Laurelhurst, and Madrona. The aggregate colors and textures can be specifically selected to reference the stone used in adjacent water features, retaining walls, or garden edging, creating a cohesive outdoor living environment.",

      step: "01",
      title: "Aggregate Selection and Mix Design",
      description: "The design phase begins with aggregate selection—a process we take seriously because the aggregate is the visual heart of the finished surface. We present clients with physical samples of available aggregate types, sizes, and color combinations in natural light conditions similar to the finished installation environment. Once aggregate is selected, our concrete supplier integrates it into the mix design at the specified ratio and gradation, balancing aggregate content against the structural cement paste needed to achieve the target PSI for the application—typically 4,000 PSI for driveways and 3,500 PSI for patios and walkways in Seattle's freeze-thaw exposure class.",
    },
    {
      step: "02",
      title: "Subgrade Preparation and Forming",
      description: "The subbase is excavated, graded, and compacted to the design depth—typically 4 inches for residential driveways and 3.5 to 4 inches for patios and walks. We compact crushed rock base over the prepared subgrade and install edge forms at the specified finish elevation, accounting for the aggregate exposure depth that will be achieved during finishing. Where exposed aggregate meets adjacent hardscape, landscape, or structure, we install control joint and isolation joint material to allow independent movement and prevent sympathetic cracking. Proper subgrade preparation is the foundation for a long-lasting slab regardless of surface treatment.",
    },
    {
      step: "03",
      title: "Concrete Placement and Initial Finishing",
      description: "Concrete is placed and struck off to form grade, then bull-floated to consolidate the surface and embed aggregate slightly below the paste surface. This initial floating stage is critical: over-floating embeds the aggregate too deeply for effective exposure later, while under-floating leaves the surface too open and causes premature aggregate exposure during the retarder phase. Our crews time this initial finishing sequence based on concrete temperature, ambient conditions, and relative humidity—all highly variable in Seattle's maritime climate—to land in the optimal window for surface retardation.",
    },
    {
      step: "04",
      title: "Surface Retarder Application and Protection",
      description: "A chemical surface retarder—a compound that inhibits cement hydration at the surface—is applied by spray to the still-plastic concrete surface immediately after bull-floating. The retarder penetrates approximately 3 to 6 millimeters into the surface paste and holds that zone in a semi-plastic state while the concrete below it hydrates and gains strength. The treated surface is covered with polyethylene sheeting to protect against rain, wind, and direct sun, all of which can alter the retarder's depth of penetration and produce inconsistent exposure. Retarder depth and dwell time are adjusted based on the aggregate size and the desired depth of exposure.",
    },
    {
      step: "05",
      title: "Wash and Exposure, Sealing, and Curing",
      description: "Between 12 and 24 hours after placement—the timing window varies with temperature and humidity—we wash and brush the surface with stiff brushes and low-pressure water to remove the retarded paste layer and reveal the aggregate beneath. Exposure depth and aggregate coverage are inspected across the entire slab to confirm uniformity before the surface is allowed to cure further. After a minimum 28-day cure, we apply two coats of a penetrating acrylic or polyurethane sealer specifically formulated for exposed aggregate that enhances aggregate color, protects against staining, and seals the surface against freeze-thaw water infiltration without creating a slick or glossy film that would compromise traction.",

    title: "Exposed Aggregate Driveway and Entry Walk, Windermere",
    neighborhood: "Windermere",
    projectType: "Residential Driveway and Front Walkway",
    challenge: "A Windermere homeowner was replacing an aging asphalt driveway and the existing plain concrete front walk that no longer matched their extensively landscaped property. The property featured a mature garden with basalt stone garden walls, a Japanese maple grove, and a river rock water feature at the front entry—the owner wanted a driveway and walk surface that complemented these natural stone elements rather than contrasting with them. The sloped driveway (approximately 6 percent grade toward Lake Washington) required careful drainage planning to prevent water from sheeting down onto the public sidewalk, and the curved entry walk alignment needed to be coordinated with an existing irrigation system that the landscaper had just installed.",
    solution: "We worked with the homeowner and their landscape architect to select a river cobble aggregate in a warm gray-tan blend that referenced the basalt and granite colors already present in the garden hardscape. The driveway was designed with a crowned centerline profile directing water to two discrete strip drains connected to the stormwater system, preventing sheet flow to the sidewalk. The entry walk was carefully formed around the irrigation system with the landscaper on site to mark valve box locations, and the mix design was specified at 4,000 PSI with air entrainment and fiber reinforcement. Exposed aggregate was achieved at a medium depth—approximately 6 millimeters—to maximize traction on the sloped driveway while keeping a refined, even texture on the entry walk.",
    result: "The finished driveway and walkway integrated seamlessly with the property's natural stone landscaping, so much so that a neighbor asked whether the aggregate had been custom-sourced to match the garden walls—it had not, but the aggregate selection process had been precise enough to achieve that appearance. The drainage system has functioned perfectly through two wet seasons, with no sheet flow reaching the public sidewalk. The homeowner's landscape architect has since referred two additional clients to Cloud Concrete for exposed aggregate work on similarly high-design properties in the Sand Point and Laurelhurst neighborhoods.",

  faqs: [
    {
      question: "How long does exposed aggregate concrete last in Seattle's climate?",
      answer: "A properly installed and regularly sealed exposed aggregate surface will provide 25 to 40 years of structural service in Seattle's climate. The exposed stone aggregate is actually more resistant to surface abrasion than the paste-rich surface of conventional broom-finished concrete, since most aggregate materials are harder than hardened cement paste. The primary threat to longevity in Seattle is freeze-thaw cycling, which can cause surface scaling if water infiltrates an unsealed surface and freezes. Regular sealing every 3 to 5 years with a quality penetrating sealer is the single most important maintenance action for maximizing the service life of an exposed aggregate surface in the Pacific Northwest.",
    },
    {
      question: "What types of aggregate are available for exposed aggregate concrete in Seattle?",
      answer: "We offer a wide range of aggregate options, and our supplier network gives us access to regional materials that are particularly well-suited to Pacific Northwest aesthetics. Popular choices include rounded Columbia River pea gravel in natural gray and tan blends, Cascade basalt chips in charcoal and dark gray, quartzite in white and cream tones, and mixed river cobble in warm earth-tone combinations. We can also incorporate decorative elements like recycled glass, polished black granite chips, or custom aggregate blends for projects where a specific design vision requires it. We recommend clients view physical samples in the actual light conditions of their site—aggregate colors can look significantly different in outdoor natural light versus indoor showroom conditions.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is exposed aggregate more slippery than regular concrete when wet?",
      answer: "Exposed aggregate is consistently more slip-resistant than smooth-finished concrete when wet—this is one of its primary functional advantages and a key reason why it is so popular for driveways, pool decks, and walkways in Seattle's rainy climate. The protruding stone aggregate breaks up the water film that forms on smooth surfaces and creates mechanical friction between the aggregate and the sole of a shoe or tire tread. The level of traction depends on aggregate size and exposure depth: larger aggregate with greater exposure depth provides more grip, while finer aggregate with shallow exposure is smoother but still significantly more traction-positive than broom-finished concrete in wet conditions.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can exposed aggregate be done on a sloped driveway in Seattle?",
      answer: "Yes, and exposed aggregate is actually an excellent choice for sloped driveways precisely because of its superior wet-weather traction. Seattle's hillier neighborhoods—Capitol Hill, Queen Anne, Beacon Hill, Magnolia, and West Seattle—have driveways with grades ranging from 5 percent to as steep as 15 percent in some cases, and a slip-resistant surface is essential for safe vehicle and pedestrian use. We adjust the concrete mix design for sloped pours to ensure the mix does not flow down the grade before achieving the initial set, and we manage drainage carefully to route runoff away from the public sidewalk and into the property's stormwater system or a discrete strip drain. We have successfully completed exposed aggregate driveways on slopes that other contractors have turned down as too challenging.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is exposed aggregate maintained, and does it need to be resealed in Seattle?",
      answer: "Yes, resealing every 3 to 5 years is the most important maintenance practice for exposed aggregate in Seattle's climate, and it is non-negotiable for preventing freeze-thaw damage. An unsealed or under-sealed surface absorbs water, which freezes in the cement paste around the aggregate stones, causes micro-fractures, and eventually leads to aggregate pop-out—the stone literally pushed out of the surface by ice expansion. Beyond sealing, routine maintenance is minimal: annual cleaning with a pressure washer at moderate pressure to remove moss, algae, and organic debris, and periodic inspection for joint sealant failure. Avoid using strong acids or alkalis for cleaning, as these can etch the cement paste and dull the aggregate. We offer a maintenance sealing program for our installed surfaces—call us at (206) 495-0997 for details.",

  localContext: "Exposed aggregate concrete has been a Pacific Northwest landscape staple for decades, and for good reason: the surface looks completely at home in a region where natural stone, river gravel, and native plantings define the outdoor aesthetic. From the Craftsman bungalows of Wallingford and Phinney Ridge to the mid-century moderns of Maple Leaf and Wedgwood, exposed aggregate driveways and patios complement virtually every residential architectural style common to Seattle. We regularly work in these neighborhoods and understand how to select aggregate colors and textures that harmonize with each property's exterior palette, hardscape, and planting design rather than competing with them.\n\nSeattle's climate is particularly well-suited to exposed aggregate as a surface choice. The mild but persistently wet winters—with over 150 rainy days per year and annual rainfall averaging 37 inches—demand surfaces that maintain traction when wet, and exposed aggregate's natural texture provides that consistently where smooth or lightly textured finishes fail. The city's steep topography, particularly in neighborhoods like Capitol Hill, Beacon Hill, Queen Anne, and the slopes of West Seattle near Alki Beach, makes slip-resistant driveways and walkways a genuine safety consideration, not just an aesthetic preference. We have installed exposed aggregate on some of the steepest residential driveways in the city and know how to manage both the pour technique and drainage design for optimal results on challenging grades.\n\nFor properties near Seattle's many parks, waterfronts, and natural areas—Gas Works Park in Wallingford, Seward Park on Lake Washington, the Ravenna Park trails, or the Burke-Gilman Trail corridor through the University District—exposed aggregate provides a paving surface that transitions naturally to the surrounding landscape rather than imposing an urban flatwork aesthetic on a naturalistic setting. When homeowners in these neighborhoods seek to connect their private outdoor spaces to the feeling of the adjacent natural environment, exposed aggregate is consistently the finish we recommend. Its honest use of natural stone material, its compatibility with Pacific Northwest plant palettes, and its proven durability in our specific climate make it an enduring choice that continues to gain popularity among Seattle homeowners who prioritize both aesthetics and performance.",

    "Reseal the exposed aggregate surface every 3 to 5 years with a quality penetrating acrylic or polyurethane sealer designed for exposed aggregate—this is the single most important maintenance action for preventing freeze-thaw scaling and aggregate pop-out in Seattle's climate.",
    "Pressure-wash the surface annually in early spring to remove accumulated moss, algae, and organic debris from the winter season; use a fan-tip nozzle at moderate pressure (1,500 to 2,000 PSI) to avoid dislodging aggregate particles from the surface matrix.",
    "Inspect and re-caulk failed control joints every 2 to 3 years with a semi-rigid polyurethane joint sealant; open joints are the primary entry point for water that causes subbase saturation and freeze-thaw damage beneath the slab.",
    "Keep leaves and organic debris cleared from the surface during Seattle's fall and winter seasons—decomposing organic matter releases tannic acids that stain the cement paste and accelerate surface degradation if allowed to remain in prolonged contact.",
    "Never apply rock salt or calcium chloride deicers to an exposed aggregate surface during freeze events; use sand for traction instead, and rely on the aggregate's natural slip resistance—deicing salts penetrate the sealer and accelerate concrete scaling and aggregate pop-out.",

  whyChooseUs: "Cloud Concrete of Seattle has been installing exposed aggregate concrete across the greater Seattle area for years, developing both the technical expertise and the local material relationships needed to deliver consistently excellent results on this demanding decorative finish. Exposed aggregate is one of the most technique-sensitive of all concrete finishes—the window between surface retarder application and wash-out is measured in hours and varies with temperature, humidity, concrete temperature, and aggregate type. Our crews have developed the experience to read these variables and time the wash-out sequence precisely, resulting in consistent aggregate exposure depth and uniformity across the entire slab. Call us at (206) 495-0997 to schedule a consultation and see aggregate samples in person.\n\nOur relationship with regional aggregate suppliers gives us access to a broad selection of PNW-appropriate materials—river gravels, basalt chips, quartzite, and custom blends—that we can present to clients in physical sample form during the design process. We do not commit to an aggregate specification from a brochure or a website image; we show clients actual material in natural light conditions so the final selection is made with full visual confidence. This attention to the design process is part of why our exposed aggregate projects consistently exceed client expectations and generate referrals.\n\nEvery exposed aggregate installation we complete includes proper joint layout, air-entrained concrete specified for Seattle's freeze-thaw exposure class, and a two-coat sealer application after the 28-day cure as a standard part of the project—not an add-on. We back our work with a written warranty and are fully licensed, bonded, and insured in Washington State. Our W-2 crew members are the same team members on every project—experienced concrete finishers who have honed the retarder and wash-out technique specific to Pacific Northwest aggregate types and climate conditions. The difference between a great exposed aggregate job and a mediocre one is entirely in execution, and execution is where Cloud Concrete of Seattle excels.",
