      title: "Industrial-Grade Load Capacity",
      description: "Our garage slabs are engineered to support modern full-size SUVs, pickup trucks, and shop equipment weighing several tons without cracking or settling. We specify the correct PSI mix design—typically 4,000 to 4,500 PSI for residential garages and 5,000 PSI or higher for workshops—and reinforce with rebar or fiber mesh as the application demands. You will never deal with cracked corners or slab deflection under a loaded truck or floor jack.",
    },
    {
      title: "Oil, Chemical, and Moisture Resistance",
      description: "Bare concrete is porous and absorbs motor oil, brake fluid, antifreeze, and road grime, creating stains that never fully lift. We integrate moisture barriers beneath the slab and offer epoxy or polyurea topcoat systems that seal the surface at the molecular level, making spills bead up for easy cleanup. Seattle's wet climate means groundwater vapor is a constant threat; our vapor-barrier installations keep your garage floor dry year-round.",
    },
    {
      title: "Slip-Resistant Surface Options",
      description: "A smooth, coated garage floor can become dangerously slick when tracked-in rain or automotive fluids coat the surface—a real risk in a city that averages 37 inches of annual rainfall. We incorporate anti-slip broadcast aggregates into our epoxy and polyurea coating systems, adding texture that maintains traction even when wet. The result is a surface that looks sharp and polished while remaining safe for foot traffic and vehicle entry.",
    },
    {
      title: "Freeze-Thaw Cycle Durability",
      description: "Seattle's winters hover near freezing, and the repeated freeze-thaw cycles that occur between November and March are responsible for more concrete spalling than almost any other factor in this region. We use air-entrained concrete mixes specifically formulated for freeze-thaw resistance, with entrained air bubbles that give water room to expand without fracturing the slab matrix. Combined with proper curing techniques and sealing, your garage floor will remain pristine through decades of PNW winters.",
    },
    {
      title: "Precision Flatness and Drainage Slope",
      description: "A garage floor that pools water encourages rust on tools and vehicle undercarriages, grows mold, and creates a slipping hazard. We laser-screed and finish every garage slab to precise F-number tolerances, with a deliberate 1/8-inch-per-foot slope toward the apron or floor drain. Water from wet vehicles, hose-downs, and cleaning sessions flows directly out rather than pooling in low spots.",
    },
    {
      title: "Long-Term Cost Savings Over Coated Panels",
      description: "Interlocking rubber or plastic tile systems marketed as garage floor solutions require ongoing replacement, crack under point loads like jack stands, and allow moisture to accumulate beneath them. A properly installed concrete slab with a quality polyurea coating costs more upfront but typically delivers 20 to 30 years of maintenance-free service. When you account for the lifecycle cost, concrete is invariably the more economical choice for Seattle homeowners who plan to stay in their homes.",

  processSteps: [
    {
      step: "01",
      title: "Site Assessment and Slab Diagnosis",
      description: "Every garage floor project begins with a thorough inspection of the existing slab—if one is present—or the subgrade if we are pouring new. We check for existing cracks, heaving caused by tree roots or glacial till movement, low spots, moisture intrusion evidence, and the condition of the existing vapor barrier. This diagnosis directly shapes our specification: whether we grind and coat an existing slab, perform structural repairs before coating, or execute a full tearout and replacement pour.",
    },
    {
      step: "02",
      title: "Subgrade Preparation and Vapor Barrier Installation",
      description: "For new pours, we excavate to the correct depth and compact the subgrade with a plate compactor to achieve the required bearing capacity—critical on Seattle's clay-rich glacial soils, which are notorious for settlement when improperly prepared. We install a minimum 10-mil polyethylene vapor barrier lapped and sealed at seams to block ground moisture transmission. A 4-inch compacted crushed-rock base is laid over the barrier to provide uniform support and drainage beneath the slab.",
    },
    {
      step: "03",
      title: "Forming, Reinforcement, and Concrete Pour",
      description: "We set forms to the specified slab thickness—typically 4 to 6 inches depending on anticipated loads—and install rebar on chairs or fiber-reinforced mix to control cracking from shrinkage and loading. Concrete is ordered from a local ready-mix plant at the correct PSI and slump for the application, placed with a boom pump or buggy, and struck off with a vibrating screed to eliminate voids and achieve target flatness. Control joints are tooled or saw-cut within 24 hours to direct any shrinkage cracking to predictable, manageable locations.",
    },
    {
      step: "04",
      title: "Curing and Surface Preparation",
      description: "Proper curing is non-negotiable: we apply a curing compound or wet-cure the slab for a minimum of 7 days to ensure the concrete achieves its design strength and maximum durability. Before any coating is applied, the cured slab surface is prepared by diamond grinding or shot blasting to open the concrete profile, remove laitance, and achieve the correct anchor profile specified by the coating manufacturer. Moisture readings are taken with a tramex meter to confirm the slab is below acceptable moisture vapor emission thresholds.",
    },
    {
      step: "05",
      title: "Coating Application and Final Inspection",
      description: "We apply the specified coating system—epoxy primer, broadcast anti-slip aggregate, and a UV-stable polyurea topcoat are our most popular combination—in controlled conditions to ensure proper adhesion and cure. Each layer is inspected for pinholes, bubbles, and coverage uniformity before the next is applied. Final inspection confirms slope, coating thickness, anti-slip texture, and overall appearance before we hand the finished floor back to you with written care and maintenance instructions.",

    title: "Detached Workshop Garage Floor, Greenwood",
    neighborhood: "Greenwood",
    projectType: "Residential Workshop Garage Slab and Polyurea Coating",
    challenge: "A homeowner in Greenwood had a 1950s-era detached two-car garage with a 3-inch slab that had settled unevenly, cracked in multiple locations, and showed extensive spalling from decades of freeze-thaw cycles and oil penetration. The client used the space as an automotive hobby shop and needed a floor that could support a two-post vehicle lift rated at 10,000 pounds, a floor jack, and heavy rolling tool cabinets. The existing slab's condition made coating alone a non-starter, and settlement on one side created a 2-inch grade differential that caused standing water after rain.",
    solution: "We demolished the existing slab, removed all debris, and regraded the subgrade to restore a consistent 1/8-inch-per-foot drainage slope toward the new center floor drain the client requested. After compacting crushed rock base and installing a 15-mil vapor barrier, we poured a new 5.5-inch reinforced slab using 4,500 PSI air-entrained concrete with fiber reinforcement for additional crack resistance. Rebar was sized and positioned specifically around the lift anchor zones to handle the concentrated uplift loads. After a 28-day cure, we ground the surface to an ICRI CSP-3 profile and applied a two-coat 100-percent solids epoxy base with broadcast aluminum oxide grit followed by two coats of aromatic polyurea topcoat in a slate-gray with black flake broadcast.",
    result: "The finished floor transformed what had been a dirty, hazardous workspace into a clean, professional-grade shop environment. The two-post lift was installed and load-tested successfully with no flex or movement. Standing water is now nonexistent, draining to the center floor drain within minutes of a hose-down. The client reported the coating survived its first winter without any peeling, bubbling, or moisture-related failure, and rated the project as one of the best investments they had made in their property.",

  faqs: [
    {
      question: "How thick should a garage floor slab be in Seattle?",
      answer: "For a standard residential garage housing passenger cars and light SUVs, a 4-inch slab on a properly compacted subgrade is the minimum acceptable thickness. However, we routinely recommend 5 to 6 inches for Seattle garages because our glacial till and clay soils are less stable than sandy or gravelly subgrades found elsewhere—thicker slabs spread loads more effectively and are less susceptible to cracking from minor subgrade movement. If you plan to use a vehicle lift, install heavy shop equipment, or store a large truck or RV, we will engineer the slab thickness and reinforcement specifically for those loads. Call us at (206) 495-0997 and we can walk you through the right specification for your use case.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is epoxy or polyurea better for a Seattle garage floor coating?",
      answer: "Both have their place, but for Seattle conditions we typically recommend a hybrid system: a 100-percent-solids epoxy base coat for excellent adhesion and chemical resistance, followed by a polyurea or polyaspartic topcoat for UV stability, abrasion resistance, and flexibility in temperature swings. Pure epoxy topcoats yellow and chalk in UV exposure and become brittle in cold temperatures, which matters during Seattle's winter months when garage temperatures can dip well below the ideal application range. Polyurea topcoats remain flexible down to extremely low temperatures, resist hot tire pickup, and are far more resistant to the moisture vapor transmission that is endemic to Seattle's wet climate. We use coating systems from proven commercial manufacturers—not consumer-grade big-box products—and back every installation with a written warranty.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can you repair my existing garage floor instead of replacing it?",
      answer: "Yes, and we assess every existing slab on its merits before recommending replacement. If the slab is structurally sound—meaning it has not settled significantly, does not have through-cracks or delamination, and the subgrade beneath it is stable—we can grind off the damaged surface layer, fill cracks with semi-rigid epoxy crack filler, patch spalled areas with polymer-modified mortar, and apply a full coating system that will last 15 to 20 years. Replacement becomes necessary when the slab has settled unevenly (creating a trip hazard or drainage problem that cannot be corrected by grinding), when structural cracks indicate subgrade failure, or when the existing slab is simply too thin to support your intended use. Our honest assessment during the site visit will tell you exactly which path makes economic sense.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a garage floor coating last in the Pacific Northwest?",
      answer: "A professionally installed 100-percent-solids epoxy and polyurea system applied to a properly prepared substrate in a residential garage typically lasts 15 to 25 years before requiring a maintenance topcoat refresh. The primary enemies of coating longevity in Seattle are moisture vapor transmission from the slab (which causes bubbling and delamination), improper surface preparation, and UV exposure if the garage receives significant direct sunlight. We mitigate all three: we test moisture levels before coating, grind or shot-blast to the correct anchor profile, and specify UV-stable polyurea topcoats. Consumer-grade epoxy paint kits purchased at hardware stores typically fail within 2 to 4 years in Seattle conditions—they are water-based, too thin, and applied without proper surface preparation.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does Seattle require a permit to replace a garage floor slab?",
      answer: "In most cases, replacing an existing interior garage slab at the same elevation does not require a City of Seattle building permit—it is classified as ordinary maintenance and repair. However, if the project involves changes to the structure above (for example, removing a post footing integral to the building frame), adding a floor drain connected to the sewer system, or changing the grade around the perimeter, permits may be required from Seattle's Department of Construction and Inspections (SDCI) or Seattle Public Utilities. When we assess your project, we will identify any permitting requirements and handle the application process on your behalf. We are a licensed, bonded, and insured contractor fully compliant with Seattle and King County regulations.",

  localContext: "Seattle's garage floors face a unique combination of stressors that contractors in drier climates rarely contend with. The region's maritime climate delivers over 37 inches of annual precipitation, and from November through March, temperatures fluctuate repeatedly across the freezing point—sometimes multiple times in a single week. This freeze-thaw cycling is the leading cause of concrete spalling and surface delamination in Seattle garages, as water infiltrates the porous surface of unsealed concrete, freezes, expands by 9 percent, and mechanically fractures the paste matrix from within. Over time, this process turns a smooth slab into a rough, crumbling surface that harbors oil, dust, and moisture. We see this pattern in garages across Greenwood, Wallingford, and Wedgwood, where older homes built in the 1940s through 1970s have original 3-inch slabs that have reached the end of their serviceable life.\n\nSeattle's soil conditions add another layer of complexity. Much of the city is underlain by glacial till—a dense, poorly sorted mixture of clay, silt, sand, and gravel deposited by the Vashon Glacier roughly 15,000 years ago. While glacial till is generally a stable bearing material when undisturbed and well-drained, it can compress or shift when saturated and subjected to load cycles. Neighborhoods like Beacon Hill, Rainier Valley, and parts of West Seattle have significant clay-rich subgrades that require careful subgrade preparation before any slab pour. Inadequate compaction or failure to manage groundwater during construction can lead to slab settlement that no coating system can correct. Our crews are experienced with Seattle's varied soil conditions and carry the equipment and knowledge to prepare subgrades correctly for the specific conditions at each site.\n\nFor homeowners in neighborhoods like Capitol Hill, Queen Anne, and Magnolia—where detached garages are often built into hillsides with significant grade changes—moisture management takes on added importance. Hillside garages frequently experience lateral groundwater intrusion through the back wall or floor perimeter, creating chronic moisture problems that compromise any coating system not specifically designed for hydrostatic pressure. We assess drainage conditions at every site and incorporate perimeter French drains, interior channel drains, and vapor barriers as needed to create a dry, coatable substrate. Our familiarity with Seattle's topography and drainage patterns, built over years of working across every neighborhood in the city, means we anticipate these challenges before they become problems on your project.",

  maintenanceTips: [
    "Sweep or blow dust and grit off the coated surface weekly—abrasive particles ground underfoot by vehicle tires are the primary cause of coating wear and surface scratching over time.",
    "Clean oil, antifreeze, and chemical spills immediately with a neutral-pH cleaner and a microfiber mop; although the polyurea topcoat resists chemical penetration, prolonged contact with brake fluid or concentrated solvents can soften the coating surface.",
    "Apply a fresh sacrificial wax or polyurea maintenance coat every 3 to 5 years to restore the surface sheen and add an additional layer of protection against abrasion, UV, and chemical exposure.",
    "Inspect control joints and slab edges annually for sealant degradation; re-caulk with a semi-rigid polyurethane joint sealant if you see gaps opening, since water infiltration at joints is the leading cause of subgrade saturation and potential slab heave.",
    "Avoid using steel snow shovels, floor scrapers with bare metal edges, or rotating wire brushes directly on the coated surface—rubber-edged snow pushers and soft-bristle deck brushes preserve coating integrity during winter cleaning.",

  whyChooseUs: "Cloud Concrete of Seattle has been installing and coating garage floors across the greater Seattle area for years, developing a deep understanding of the specific challenges that PNW climates and Seattle's unique soil conditions present for concrete slab work. We are not a paint crew with a floor grinder—we are experienced concrete contractors who understand slab design, subgrade engineering, moisture management, and coating chemistry from the ground up. When you call us at (206) 495-0997, you speak with someone who has poured hundreds of slabs in this region and can give you an honest, technically informed assessment of what your garage floor needs.\n\nOur coating systems are sourced from industrial-grade commercial manufacturers—the same products used in car dealership showrooms, commercial warehouses, and food processing facilities—not the consumer-grade water-based epoxy paints available at big-box retailers. We invest in proper surface preparation equipment, including commercial diamond grinders and shot blast machines, because we know that a coating is only as good as the substrate it bonds to. Every job includes moisture vapor testing before coating, and we will not apply a coating to a slab that fails that test—even if it means delaying the project to allow the slab to dry or installing an appropriate moisture-mitigating primer system.\n\nWe stand behind our work with written warranties and are fully licensed, bonded, and insured in the state of Washington. Our crews are W-2 employees—not subcontracted day labor—meaning the same skilled technicians who quote your project are the ones who show up to execute it.
