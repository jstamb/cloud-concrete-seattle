## Common Questions

### How much does a concrete driveway cost in Seattle?
Concrete driveways in Seattle typically range from $8-15 per square foot for standard broom finish, $12-20 for stamped or decorative options. A typical 2-car driveway (400-600 sq ft) costs $4,000-$12,000 depending on finish and site conditions.

### How long does concrete take to cure in Seattle's climate?
In Seattle's temperate climate, concrete reaches initial set in 24-48 hours and can support foot traffic. Full cure takes 28 days. We recommend waiting 7 days before vehicle traffic on driveways.

### Do you need a permit for a concrete driveway in Seattle?
Most residential driveway replacements in Seattle don't require permits if the footprint stays the same. New driveways or expansions may require SDOT approval. We handle all permit coordination.

### What's the best concrete finish for Seattle rain?
Broom finish and exposed aggregate are the best choices for Seattle's wet climate, providing slip resistance. Stamped concrete with non-slip sealant is also popular for patios.
